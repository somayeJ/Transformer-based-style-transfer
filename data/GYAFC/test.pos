if it's unimportant, then why is she dating another woman?
please , do not attempt this. you deserve more. you could, but don't.
asian women are similar to the women of old.
inform her that it disturbs you. if she doesn't terminate, hasten departure.
i would advise you to wait until she is ready to wear a brassiere.
i prefer a friend to whom i can talk.
make him believe you are interested in his best friend.
send your ex-partner a nice valentine's day gift.
it is not over until it is over.
select my avatar and look at my questions. they are very similar.
do not say that, because most men are not unintelligent.
you are making me feel as though i just took two benadryl pills.
and it does not matter if you are shy, correct?
and if i got broken up for it, i would deserve it.
that does not mean he does not care about you.
guys are bad kissers because they do not know they are a bad kisser.
you need to move on.
your insticts are always the best sign if you are doubting him.
i like a girl with dark hair, dark eyes, and olive skin.
if he is attractive and you really like him, then i would, but that is my opinion. you have to decide for yourself.
i only care about who she is now.
too risky if you ask me, which, of course you just did.
when the ache from the love consumes, then perhaps.
call me and we will talk about this one.
i think she preoccupied and won't notice if someone else likes her.
let me know if you find mine because i want it back.
they don't want to be your friend anymore?
i do not think its a good idea unless you have a perfect partner.
did you ask him why he cheated?
that is very revealing.
they are very untruthful.
you need to leave her.
invite him to go to dinner or a movie.
love them, because god granted you love first.
you may learn from it.
the duplicate reason that the majority of women are simpleminded.
learn how to spell. i am unable to comprehend your question.
find someone better, someone that you deserve.
i am not sure, but you have to be careful.
it is not all about how long, it is about how long and how thick.
try a card if you are unable to say "i love you".
go and buy something that he would like to see you wear.
do not force it because you may make a mistake.
why should she miss someone who was not hers to begin with?
no, because my breasts are too large.
i see it all over the internet, so i was just wondering.
it is not very sexy if you ask me.
before you make a big mistake, have a conversation about this.
just stand in front of her and tell her that you are the man of her dreams.
well, how old are you because i would like to be your friend.
their way of thinking is merely different from yours.
continue with your life and find someone else.
i think you have a boyfriend now.
the one i had with your mother.
do any other girls feel the same way?
are not you really asking how many minutes into the first date?
i like him but do not know if he likes me.
sometimes it does not matter if you know how to useit.
what kind of friend are you looking for?
how much do your testicles sweat?
lately he avoids me and will not talk to me.
dance for him with something attractive!
i like girls with nice personalities.
i like school teachers, but i am not a teacher.
however, on occasion, he behaves as if he continues to do so.
it's dependent on the maximum length you'd allow me to travel.
he clearly is attempting to engage a different female, therefore, i would withdraw.
i wish you a happy st. valentine's day.
i am always happy including when waking up this morning and at work right now.
have i told you recently that i find you attractive?
act dignified and do not lose hope if things do not work out.
there are some goo men from the country that would love to have a relationship with a good women from the country.
ask her out on a casual date.
please do not encourage you girlfriend to become a stripper.
that behavior is certainly flirting.
my boyfriend is crazy about my toes.
if you love someone, you sacrifice being with other people.
good luck to you and have a wonderful day.
i had intercourse with a male, who functioned mechanically.
does he still care for me? or is he playing games with me?
if you love another person, it is due to who they are, not the color of their skin.
there is not supposed to be any false love, i guess "true love" is just a euphemism.
if you still desire your ex, don't approach anyone new.
there's no need to play games.
it's possible that his girlfriend's homeliness drives him to seek satisfaction elsewhere.
talk to her. approach her and ask her to dinner, or something similar.
if she likes you, that's great!
it is alright, now, yaar.
ask them to hang out, sometime.
first of all, do not call them stupid or ugly because they like you.
maybe he believes it is your fault that you have a baby.
i do not believe on can realize that early.
there must be a reason why she is getting jealous.
he needs to experience it for himself.
locate me for a good time.
no, but he thinks you are more beautiful at night, because your father is sleeping.
you are a beautiful person and should not be jealous, just go out there and have fun!
do not let these female tell you lies!
a question that made you laugh uproariously.
you are a sad individual.
explain it to him if he asks.
what if they were gentlemen?
do not be tied up; go out and have fun.
do not ask him out, rather, jab at him until he asks you out.
perhaps because you are unique.
a good was is to look straight into his eyes, and you will get the answer.
also, we do not really want our mothers to be liars.
we all have a "love language," so find out his and use it to tell him.
you do not want to spend the rest of your life with someone like thant, do you?
everytime i bring up the subject he accuses me of pushing him.
i would believe he is having sex with another person.
sometimes i travel back to my hometown to get away. my hometown is located across the country from where he is.
remember, this man needs to help with your expenses as well.
just laugh, you will feel better.
he is a man. what did you expect?
it could be. it sounds like he likes being around you. you never know what could happen.
why does the color of someone's skin matter?
you should calm down and go to the wedding.
my email address is _num_@yahoo.com. i enjoy new friends.
if a african american man breaks into my house it is safe to assume that african americans are criminals.
don't let it affect you so severely.
i like women who are expressive and outgoing.
if he comes from money, then you should stay with him.
they will cheat, and then write you a letter.
i do not think he would lie to you if you ask him.
have a good life, and do not let him weigh you down.
the man you are talking to is a psychopath.
the next day i went with my boyfriend to eat at the place we were going to.
there are no men worth dating in this town.
i want her to be attracted to me.
you shouldn't think those things, no one will like your attitude.
did his boss get angry at him?
she has a constant fear.
there are beautigul girls everywhere.
because distance can make lies harder to hide.
although you said it was mutual, i expect he would go to jail here.
by the way, there are plenty of commercials that will tell you condoms are not adequate protection, but something is better than nothing!
if each week there is a different one, then i doubt it. you should, however, check the signs, especially eye contact and flirting.
should i break up with her, or go with it and trust she truly loves me?
do not ever go to places that you hung out in, in the past.
should i go back or stay home?
you should not feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down. life is too long.
yes, you love him, but do you want to risk him getting an std and giving it to you?
most men are not stupid, you are just meeting the wrong people.
i think it is a myth that men are dumb, sex-driven fiends.
even if it is acceptable, your partner does not need to know everything you think about.
unless, of course, if was a good dream.
if he only wants to be your friend, i believe it is best for you to move on.
what you do to anothers affects what happens to you.
it depends, of course, upon the man.
it is simple:; purchase a flower for him and tell him that you love him.
say goodbye to her, as life is way too short for this
you know that we do it, too!
the boy is about _num_ to _num_ years old and he likes me.
but have fun if you decide to do it.
there is not much you can do if a man does not want to have a realtionship with you.
do the things that make you happy.
it depends on the girl. i lie often and people believe it.
the best place to live is in your imagination. if that is all that you want, you will never get anything.
it is not good to date them all.
have you ever heard of a pajama party?
men like women who can spell, or woman who are not too lazy to look up words.
if you don't comprehend, then why respond? it might be an oddball.
i have been there before. the site is quite exceptional.
as for the man, attempt to avoid him. eventually, all will be forgotten.
the answer to your query, is that men are incomprehensible.
i want to reach out to meet friends in amsterdam.
she does not act like she is interested in me, so what should do, date her or leave her alone?
you should proceed cautiously, no man likes to hear that he is not a good kisser.
that is similar to asking if love ever existed, not everyone is bad.
do you suffer from schizophrenia, or some other mental illness?
what is it that you like others to ask you?
cover yourself in a whipped cream or something of that nature.
don't wait for an opportunity.
what do you do if he is really cute?
if he doesn't pay child support, call the police.
even if they laugh at the time.
i am not sure what to do.
first and foremost, for him to say so, shows the kinds of man that her really is.
if it is because you like someone else, then say that.
they are going to have to learn the hard way because they are mean and unwise.
it makes for quick access.
i am confused because he has too many female friends.
good job being a virgin because it is a sing to not be.
can you stop trying to control her life?
why would a man want to go on a date with someone as unfeeling as you?
i am merely attempting to avoid quarrels. she becomes jealous with ease.
some men are afraid of marriage, etc. so you having a meaningful conversation might help.
men, why would you want or not want to be in a relationship with a virgin?
it is because they have no brain and think their head hurts but boys are just being boys.
it is why so many men dream about living with an asian girl.
but i guess it really depends upon whether you want an emotional attachment.
close your eyes and do your own thing.
once someone cheats, they will always cheat again.
speak to me. you cannot be that lonely!
it's your anger that makes you say that you can't hurt me anymore.
honestly, that is very sexy in and of itself.
be with someone who is more compatible with your maturity level.
i would not be attracted to her in the first place.
it is healthy and natural, but you can get viruses if you are not careful.
take a good look in the mirror.
he is done with you because he got what he wanted.
most men are aroused all of the time.
question your best friend to find out how much of a friend they are.
do not take him back if you are considering it.
send him a message from your phone!
god moves in many ways.
when you are at least sixteen.
he loves you and you are his one and only.
oh my goodness, i had the same problem, look at the answers that i got.
your time and your life.
think nothing of it, he will understand.
hope that helps, even just a little bit.
try to remember that the leading cause of divorce is marriage.
if he is unwilling to lick it then do not let him stick it.
i wish you would have no issue getting sex.
i did that and it was not good.
you cannot just force yourself on anyone, or you will end up with noone.
if you are not growing together, and having fun, then the relationship will die.
i also have that problem, but, if you are good in bed, i am pretty sure she will not even notice.
get her thing that actually have meaning.
how old are you?
if you have younger friends will help make you think and feel younger.
i do not like you.
i do not think he deserved to have it.
you get out of life what you put into it.
yes, it is possible, it acutally happens to me a lot.
no, i'm a girl, i only think about sex if i'm really in love with someone.
if he is cheating then kick him to the curb.
and think of this if you think of nothing else. he may be bring std home to you.
no, there is no way that girls will ever understand guys.
party it up while you are young.
i heard you are getting married, so when is the date?
honesty works for me so you should try it.
asking you out is up to him, so you missed your chance.
however, i absolutely love italian women!
i amstill trying to figure that one out myself.
if she is very ugly, then yes, no intercourse is beneficial.
why are the most exciting sports the ones with the most physical contact?
once you have moved on then you will not care if does or does not move on.
firstly, that is not typical of a man.
i am sure most women talk about it, they have novelty parties with sex toys.
the exception is that it did not end well.
give it some thought beforehand so that you do not get tongue tied.
you should wait until you are married.
if she does it again, shame on you for allowing it.
this started with flirting about three months ago.
you should go out with your friends to meet new friends.
he will find a way to run into you while you are out.
even though valentine's day is over, get her some flowers and chocolate.
i do not like the bad boy type as a partner.
while singing silly songs, it is fun to sing as off key as possible.
try setting them up on a blind date.
i married someone i met at a strip club.
i may want it more than guys do.
their brains are less mature than ours.
he and i met through his brother.
you should think it through well.
yes there are, but i am not one of them.
my name is shaba, please send me a friend in amsterdam.
i am not a prude at all, since i am good looking and love oral sex.
that is just like most of the time guys do not understand girls.
your best friend is not your friend if he had sex with your girl.
i do not know, maybe i was just not born to lie so much.
the least she could say is no.
i think about sex all the time, more so than all of my male friends.
it feels bad, which saddens me. goodbye.
it is sad how some people are.
listen to the song "baby baby stay gone" by jimmy wayne.
i do not even speak with other men.
if that does not work, i do not know what advice to give you, because it works for me at times.
if she already has a male partner, you must set your sights elsewhere.
you support everything you say to her; it is fairly simple.
it may not fit in your mouth.
as family comes first, ask him if he likes your children.
the way they look at you and talk to you can be a tell tale sign.
i have been to some.
not all girls, but some do.
you should stop calling and see if he misses you.
the future is not bright.
what are the signs of a man flirting with you?
why would you kill a child?
your guess is as good as mine is.
mine is eight to nine inches.
bill gates was probably undesirable, but look at him now!
strike one is that he does not like kids.
best friends always take priority over women.
a girl who loves and cares for him.
do not run, he is only talking.
you may want to stay friends with him.
if this guy says no, he will not help.
ignore it when people start rumors.
if you find out, please let me know.
i am only trying to be fair.
it saddens me to say this, but she was unfaithful to you when you were still in a relationship.
i invited her over, we went inside my room, and i closed the door.
there is an extremely attractive man in my neighborhood.
i am a gemini; however, i honestly do not believe in horoscopes.
it serves as the single item extremely sober-minded women are sober-minded in regard to.
as opposed to a female, you're best to obtain a male in service to your preference.
however, i derive pleasure from heavy petting, including even a small amount of stroking.
i do not think too much about it.
do not say too much, simply say hello.
hold your head up and smile.
my advise would be to not look back.
is it acceptable to have sexual relations with my girlfriend?
if you have a child, then your child obviously has a father as well.
for a good time, we went to certain clubs.
so, that is your answer. yes, they said that they will not cheat.
would sex with more than one guy at once?
personally, i do not think that it is useful.
what if you are interested in a lady, but not certain if she feels the same?
when your boyfriend does not answer my instant message you or call you for three weeks, what would you do?
if you have to ask, you are most likely too young to be married.
most men are like that, yes.
it is up to you, don't try look too hard.
it means dating will be difficult for you.
my male friends say confidence is key.
well maybe you can give her a telephone call or work really hard in order to make some money to purchase a car.
sleep with one of his family members or his best friend.
alternatively, you could spread rumors about her, from where ever you happen to be.
your are saying that i should not send an instant message that says asl?
i am telling you this from personal experience.
however, women do talk about it a lot!
she did it one time, so shame on her.
it can even help your relationship.
so spill the beans and let things fall where they may.
i saw them last year and they were great.
do you truly want someone who does not know what he wants?
allow her to try on a sports brassiere.
tell her that you love her, and attempt to earn money.
you all know you were thinking it.
i do not know you well enough to love you.
stop having sex with him, which you should not be doing in the first place.
you get bored easily when with him or her.
you know your man, so do not worry if you trust him.
you know what you should do.
ask him about it and if he denies it and you know he is cheating, then break up with him.
if a person made you truely happy, you would be glad to say back off and not flirt.
regardless of how right it seems, do nothing for st. valentine's day.
homosexuals enjoy listening to them.
if he called, it was at least one a week.
most men are not slow, just the ones with which you associate.
i would say that is not okay, just because he's a guy doesn't mean its right.
my wife said it depends on her mood at the time.
well, if you are really looking for advice, don't do it.
first of all, don't do anything that you don't want to do.
is it because he doesn't trust me?
you are young. you need to have a conversation with your mother about that.
i am sorry but it will always be awkward and slightly strange.
i want some good love songs to listen to. i know it is foolishly sentimental but i do not care.
divorce is not something that children enjoy.
tell her there is something you have been wanting to tell her.
i can't believe he is talking to you.
i believe being in a relationship is wonderful.
this is the first time i have ever done something for someone else, advice would be lovely.
keep it that way, no matter how made she gets.
that is an ignorant question. if you do not know, you never will.
i apologize, but since i do not live there i cannot give you advice.
ak her why she is in a relationship and her feelings for you.
i prefer it from behind.
they prefer being on the top or bent over.
follow your feelings, what feels right to you?
don't let another girl take the person you like.
love without intercourse until after marriage is what's best.
i can't help thinking about this man i like, i try to focus hard on my work to avail.
that is a good question. i am a woman, so other women will never know.
that is possibly the worst thing you could do to your friend right now.
you are not interested in him, but in his friend. why do you not tell him?
i hope you acquire some new friends soon.
unfortunately, if you have to ask, then the answer would be, "probably."
would you marry me?
intercourse is an important as air and water.
do not give him too many chances.
if you like her, then it is okay.
i know he love me even more since i was still a virgin on our wedding night.
i would not agree that girls should attack first.
it depends upon whether you are also a young woman or not.
as a man, i know many men are in relationships for personal gain.
has anyone had sex with their spouse before marriage?
is that question directed for men?
look somewhere else for answers.
have some patience and give him a chance to get to know your children.
how old are you and your mother?
you are most likely too young to get married if you are asking these questions.
you should wait and see what she has to say.
take it easy, do not jump on him.
the book is called 'he's just not that into you.'
you are not a good person if you cheat.
you have to exude confidence, be flirty but sweet.
refuse to have sexual intercourse with him then see what he does, great advice i know!
i am really attracted to him!
it's no problem if you agree with him, but what are your feelings?
most importantly, remember to have fun!
however, it does not mean the relationship is over because of what happened.
i know he would not want me to do that either.
they do not have to be of the christian faith in order to cheat. the women are guilty of it as well.
i am sure that they think the same thing about girls.
you can use actions or phrases to show a person you like them.
if he did date her, he would not cheat.
we never got together because i was with his best friend, matt.
as long as he genuinely does not know of the females, it will matter not.
alas, you ought to be rather respectable about it too.
well, he is fourteen or sixteen, and how aged are you?
i cannot believe i wasted years of my life committed to an inferior human such as yourself.
i am wanting to make things more interesting in my room. what should i try?
but that requires time to develop.
tell him honestly about the phone call.
he is in love with another woman.
i would have sex even if she was still dripping from his sex.
my friends cannot stand him and constantly pick on him.
let your personality shine through and do not be fake because women can sense that.
that is amusing because i felt like that about a girl once but cannot explain why.
get accustomed to men who want to use you.
it is fate that does that.
my mother's friend willy lives there. find people on myspace, there are tons of people from everywhere.
grab a male whom you have never met and sleep with them or get married immediately.
have a picnic lunch in a beautiful,quiet setting.
you should be careful not to end up in a hostel.
what is wrong with enjoying yourself?
when you want to give him a bear hug every time you see him.
everything reminds me of him and what used to be.
it is so natural, why make issue out of it?
i just broke up with my girlfriend but it is harder to get another one can you help me.
did he do it on purpose?
i was thinking if i should kiss her next time.
i love this girl.
i hope she is not their boss.
i do not like that.
it depends on the both of you.
if she doesn't enjoy the time she spends with you, enough to remain with you, it's not worth it.
i am thirteen years old, and _num_
have a fun, and though provoking honeymoon!
my boyfriend is always watching women, while he's driving. he attempts to not be obvious.
i dislike people like those. remember money buys many things, apart from class, style and grace.
don't take matters into your own hands, she will get hers soon.
people would know if you felt that no one would like you.
life is just people hurting one another.
i lost my virginity when i was _num_, and i didn't understand what the big deal was all about.
ask him if he minds that you sent such salacious pictures.
you need to be careful before you get pregnant.
you are not stupid. you know the truth.
did you say 'for better or worse?'
you run to him everytiime he calls for you.
you are my best friend in the world.
a baby cannot decide if it wants to live or die.
it makes me feel good when guys hit in me and flirt with me.
one said, "i cannot leave my kids," while the other said, "why do you want to have coffee with me?"
where is he working and how many hours does he work?
eighteen, however, there is no need to hurry.
some men truly dislike any anal stimulation.
women are mysterious and we prefer it that way.
however, i truly do love her.
i do not think he does not trust you.
i like a young man who was once in my class.
i enjoy receiving advice.
is it not painful for one of them and about the ego for the other?
tell them that you love them, and see if they tell you that back.
that is who we are because it is in our genetics, and there is nothing you can do about that.
i make so much noise our neighbors have made complaints against us.
well, one particular afternoon, i had him take a seat and i informed him of my romantic feelings.
behave directly...ahem, do you gentlemen plan to include me in this discussion, or what's the alternative?
he shall most certainly obtain it at some future time.
in the event this young man is fond of you, you'd be best to accompany him.
select me, however, provide a bit more specificity regarding category or stereo. in other words, age is also a consideration!
nobody has the ability to dictate their dream's behavior.
are you even still not familiar with the paris hilton video recording?
you should take my word for it: guys do not know what is best for a girl.
you could go out with one of his friends and then gauge his reaction.
she claims that it is not important and yet it is the dream of every guy.
you should have some fun with your best friends to take your mind off of him.
i cannot respond because i have not experienced it, but it seems possible.
i believe that she wants to come to america, like everyone else. that is my opinion. good-bye.
he probably thinks that it is a good matter.
the admiration is friendly and just not enough reason to kiss.
crying is okay, but talking is much more productive.
pregnant females become less interested in that fashion.
converse with the man and determine the reasons for his loathsome behavior.
might i court an exotic dancer? unlikely.
you've become uninterested in engaging with him personally.
he did not care if he knew.
some guy was following me in a store and said that he never liked levi's jeans until now. i ran.
they are no longer best friends.
i want to be myself and not scare her away. what should i do?
from the sound of it, you are more interested in virginity than are most guys.
you should give him the news without having sex with him so you don't come off as being cheap.
she apparently never recovered from breaking up with you the first time.
why did you marry him when he is introverted and now you want him to be talkative?
be young and enjoy your life. do not consider life too seriously.
i am sorry, but no. get a job.
no, if you are over forty years old then you might as well be eighty years old.
i do not like to hurt anyone.
no, he merely enjoys talking with you.
your three year old child already has a father.
i want my ex to understand that it is only him that i desire.
find some barry white music, it always works.
you could find me the most beautiful, tall blonde girl but she would not be intelligent.
reflecting on the past, i am still not sure why i did it.
you sound very sorry, so you should.
be honest and ask what he thinks, that is where you should start.
i ruined the friendship between jon and matt.
it probably wasn't a great idea for him to tell you, but don't worry about it too much.
i'm fond of one particular gentleman, jon, and in the past, he had fondness for me, as well.
and to reach the very apex, i wasn't able to attend because the headboard item eliminated the entire ambiance.
i'd award you a _num_ points in response to that entry!
they possess numerous outstanding suggestion items within that location.
begin conversing on the subject of children in the company of your parentage.
i did not; i let the man come to me and ask me out.
i found out that my girlfriend was transgender.
she knows she needs to move on but cannot; do you have any ideas that might help her?
you have answered your own question.
they think that they are popular and attractive. they are, yet only when it comes to dating.
for the majority of time, it is quiet. however, if it is very good, then i will be louder.
some like to cuddle, some do not.
do not be dense like i have been.
i am the one who did not do anything wrong. i love him so much. what should i do?
it is not the only thing.
john and i used to be close. we would talk about all things constantly.
he informs you that he does not want to do it right now?
i began smoking and drinking.
why waste your time on an individual that would disrespect you.
if women are not attracted to you because of it. is their own problem.
can't he have a woman share hers?
my advise is to not date a stranger.
be honest with him and yourself. do you really want him back?
go to iraq and keep in touch.
at times, i think only sex.
when a girl likes you, you should be able to know. help me girls!
they just want to be loved.
you could compromise by refusing to accompany her when she has been drinking.
on the contrary, he tells me that they have no meaning for him.
press ahead and leave this behind, my friend. have fun.
i think that your feeling for him is only lust.
in addition, you should tell him that you had a bad experience with another guy that tried some things that made you angry.
you should not obtain another dog for him.
for me, it is a woman being mature.
was i not attractive in his mind that night?
he does not love you. break up with him and do not listen to his excuses.
i would work with him some more.
believe me, people are not always who they first appear to be.
you cannot stop it; it is like a reflex and we are simply prone to do it.
i, for one, dislike breast augmentations.
that is how life works. there will always be good and bad times in it. accept it.

find someone new, because you would not have gotten married.
we make them nervous, and they can not think straight.
they like to make you feel bad.
i think they are more romantic.
you are too young, and too many things can go wrong.
there is a reason why this happened, so simply be patient; every negative situation has a positive aspect. i am sending you my support.
remember, just because a young man knows you are romantically involved does not mean he will not try at any rate.
i would not spend any time on a young woman that is unintelligent, even if she is extremely attractive.
yes, it is beneficial not to have intercourse.
can a guy be too tired for sex?

why not poke out every man's eyes?
it means you have a new little sister.
i am _num_ and i waited until i was married to have intercourse.
yes, that is fine; everyone is attracted to other people.
do men even find that attractive?

you should leave him, because simply because you love him does not mean he loves you.
because pain and bleeding can be an almost orgasmic pleasure.

very funny, there is no way that i am going to post that kind of personal information!
that sounds like a break up to me.
my boyfriend of a year plus has been lying to me throughout our relationship.
it is the same reason that mine is.

i will never forget that odd moment when i fell to my knees.
she doesn't trust me, because i have expressed similar sentiments to the both of them.
i can assure you that girls are unaware of what real sexual intercourse is.

what reason exists for your failure to obtain employment; in such a case, you'd have your own funds.
they're in love, they believe they have hope.

you marry someone because you want to spend the rest of your life with them.
he always apologizes, but a month later, he's back to his dishonest ways.

it really depends on whether she is unattractive, and how much so.
therefore, make sure she knows you care for her.
don't tell him in person! that may have worked at one point, but it will not work now.
own up to everything, even if you don't want to.
and, believe me, it can get bad.
men don't fear the word "love".
perhaps he simply wants to hear your voice before he tucks himself in to bed.
would you kiss him passionately, even if you were not in a relationship?
you are wrong about that. you have personal issues, correct?
when you cannot stop thinking about that person.
i would ask her if it was yours.
how could anyone not like children?
i've married two times. with the first one, i knew right away. my second marriage is still unravelling.

actually, i prefer hispanic men above all others races.
if i do, then why would i be snooping around in his things?
it is not love, but who knows, right?
you should definitely force her because no bra is very unattractive.
did the flirting lead you to believe that he wanted more?
if that does not work, tell him that you have a sexually transmitted disease.
she is not that special to others, but she is my true love.

no, you must be smart.
if you are talking about the internet, that is the wrong place.
i've heard that men prefer virginal women.
as odd as it sounds, i like a small bottom, and small breasts.

if he doesn't like her, then it would be of her best interests to move on.
you have obviously made your decision about being sexually active with him.
how many years have you been married?
say yes if you like him and no if you do not!
trust your humor, beauty, intelligence, personal charm and things like that.

do not compromise your salvation for anyone.
i am attracted to bad boys.
we got together _num_ months ago when i was _num_ years old, and we are still together.
do you think that she will know that you like her if you do not tell her?
just do not tell her that you love her too early in the relationship.
they can never be what you are.
i still care about hima lot and miss him.
you two broke up so let him take care of it.
i noticed you like the goo goo dolls and wonder if you have ever seen them in concert.
perhaps she is not the kind of woman to care about materialistic items.
there is no way to answer that without sounding racist (which i am not).
it is basically deciding who i want to marry.
remember it's your decision. you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
later in the month, things became unstable.
inform her to reconsider.
how about a nice, homemade, personalized gift?
then, it is up to her to listen or not, and discover it in a difficult manner or not.
they are not the sort of male you desire.
have you ever had a falling out such as that?
you are unaware of his true age?
as little as is possible. forgive and forget.
older, i mean in three to five years, so he'll mature.
at least you may have confidence in us, if we lie, you'd know.

hit him upside the head.
you may not like it but pretend to.
marriage is better but no one said that it was going to be easy.

i am no longer attracted to you.
if i did, yahoo answers would not be where i would look!

if my husband cheated, i would probably chop off his penis and hang it from the mustang's rearview mirror.
i get hungry twice a day.
i laughed hard when i read it.
i enjoy talking to him. it is as if i do not feel good unless i have talked to him.
friends are hard to come by.
mr. nobody got drunk and kissed her, that was what i did three years ago.
if he has that sort of attitude, he isn't deserving of your love.
that is what i decided on matt.
my yahoo username use to be iscreamifyoudoitright.
just ask her, she will probably like you to have some help.
they will get it.
my wife gave me a kiss and went with the children.
undress yourself in front of him and you will know.
after that, i learned that he is interested in me.
i am because if i was not, then i would be with a woman.
if he has friends, then maybe he is interested in you.
why would a guy not date a virgin?
who on here has married the person they were in a relationship with in high school?
have you seen the motion picture "the game?"
you should leave him alone because he got what he wanted and perhaps no longer wants to talk to you.
you may get into trouble if you do not leave him alone.
i would not have gotten as many dates if i had acted ignorant.
you will be attracted to me once you see me.
but you are probably too good for her, anyway.

you do not. break up with that woman because she will remain simply to hurt you and enjoy it.
it is simple. tell him to either discuss it with you or to leave. that is all.
simply say, "i love me, too."
it is not as good for the person who is available.
it is obvious that if she will not tell you then she does not want you to know.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said no.
look at the pictures of the the two of you.
do what your heart believes is right.
why aren't you employed?
just try to remain calm, and don't take women for granted.
you're not very bright, if you were my child you wouldn't be allowed to date.
she is using you to cross over.
talk to him, and tell him to stop.
i need to know if it is okay.
be sexually intimate before you go to sleep.
show him that you care by listening if he speaks about it.
do not do that to yourself!
that is the same reason why men do it.
dude you'll forget about that and move on.
a boyfriend is a friend too.
i was dating my new girlfriend, and i dumped her.
if you think he is cute and has a nice personality, then say, "yes."
tell him that you love him, if he likes you, then that will get things moving. it worked like a charm for me.
sure, if you are a boy.
i am scared to ask him if he has feelings for me because i have feelings for him.
ask her permission is you are in doubt.
you don't need him, or anybody bring you down.
i couldn't ever hurt anyone i care for.
have you cheated on her previously?
woman like that are terrible.
no, but you can be.
there are secret admirer notes with clues leading to you.
do not tell him that face to face.
you have to get to know her.

she is still your friend.
i know a lot about this topic. send me an e-mail and i will help you.
do not attempt to impress her. simply let her know that you are interested in her.
do you have irish in you?
maybe that is why they call it a fantasy.
some learn and do well, while others do not.
however,they do not have to be half naked
if you find the answer, please let me know.
i would treat you with about the same degree of respect and consideration i do a store-bought dessert.
i am quite mature, so it would be unwise to cross me.
do not simply approach him and say crude things about intercourse with his sister.
until then, you should stop being mean.
if you truly like him, you will know.
they are not a bad person.
it does not matter if you do it right.
you should be nice and relaxed and then let her know that you like her.
people only do things if there is something in it for them.
in my opinion a woman should make that decision for herself.
call him and ask.
i am a _num_ year old female.
there are lots of reasons why some people have not found the right person.
you can still be friends, even friends with benefits.
you really want him to propose to you.
forget that jerk and go out with me!
just do it because if you wait you will never get anywhere.
you just have to be normal.
every so often, i will not, just for a change of pace.
you should starting looking for someone who is more compatable and closer to your age.
have i told you recently that i like you?
it has several different meanings.
i begin by remarking on what they are wearing.
when you are attracted to a man, who is attracted to you.
then you are not getting any, my friend.
next, you should focus completely on getting to "level three" really fast, alright?
to prevent herself from getting pregnant, she should decide.
no. as a woman, i do not think about sexual relations as much as my ex-boyfriend did.
i do not like emotionally weak people, though.
why would you want to marry someone who is in prison?
we have courted each other often, but i do not know.
it is not men in general, it is the one with whom you were in a relationship.
but i instantly did not like him.
there are many questions on the state of my mind, and body.
talk to him with your eyes, not your mouth.
women want to take their time, savor the moment, men want to get straight to it.
we sat on my bed together, and i looked into her eyes before going in for the kiss.
why would i get married to lose my status as a free man?
you have to accept the sad truth.
do you love your ex-girlfriend at all?
your choices are to get over him, or wait.
besides, these days it is diffcult to find a virgin!
please repeat after me. you are a dishonest jerk.
i am merely curious. thank you for answering.
spend time with some rough men. "manly" men.
i care for him very much, but only as a friend.
i am self diagnosed nymphomaniac, i am not sure if i am disgusting, or just craving intercourse all the time.
she may come clean to you if she doesn't want you to date anyone.
if you don't want to have intercourse, it is fine.
who ended the relationship?
dress decently, and you will find nicer men.
i will attempt anything once, and do it again if i like it.
as long as there is no physical activity, i see no reason why not.
i do not know. are you ready for one?
jon told me to remain with matt.
he will be pleasantly surprised, and will love you more for it.
i told him yes.
i would cheat on her with one of her friends and then treat her friend better than you treated her.
if you are not planning to marry him, why bother?
the issue is that the women that do smell, believe they do not.
many men care about that, and some do not. it is up to the man.
tell him to go to away.
you should find self-esteem and leave him.
it is likely the woman who do not like weak men.
yes, men do think about sex more than women.
perhaps it is because you are doing something wrong.
older does not mean that he will soon die.
do you have reasons to not trust him?
hand him a toilet brush.
if you want to listen to more, send me an email.
get married if you want to.
i think that astrology is fake.
just ask him outright if he will marry you.
too much of a good thing can become burdensome, unfortunately.
they have only one thing on their minds.
so, he does not like your children, and you do not like his?
while you are single you should have all the fun you want to have!
it is called lust, which is a sin.
i have some anxiety about it.
my new girlfriend means a lot to me.
make sure that it is good, clean fun.
now you get two of everything!
there's a perfect man for every woman!
i suggest sightseeing, attending movies, et cetera.
well, that's a bit difficult.
you need to get angry!
maybe she would like to have intercourse, but not with you.
where did you get this information?
if you connect with someone do not worry about other people's feelings.
i love having phone sex with my boyfriend.
tell him nicely to his face that it is over.
it is easy to find someone to marry you in the jail.
what if a man would ask why all women are sluts?
she may do the same thing again. thank you, i will let him know.
do not let anyone tell you anything different.
if the guy and girl get married, she should not have slept with many other men.
i am an old-fashioned person.
if you are with an unsaved sinner then you are a sinner also.
you will have no physical contact, no eye contact, nor any hand contact. you will only have the faith that that the other one is telling the truth.
maybe she has the same feeling for you as you have for her.
good looks, good habits, and, of course, a great figure all makes a good girlfriend.
get a job and send him money?
give her something special, then ask right then and there.
if you do not tell her, she will believe you are hiding something.
looks are not as important compared to how someone treats you.
can anyone here speak english?
it is about the one you are with.
what person who be able to respond negatively to such a thing?
duplicate my phrasing as follows: i am not in a position of blame!
i possess a pair: you render your own determination.
she inquired of me concerning my emotions...
my partner doesn't behave as such. he simply doesn't hesitate to begin and becomes immediately immersed.
one day he just started to flirt with me.
only if you feel like you are in need of a boyfriend.
no, the same thing happened to me, only slightly different.
would he be bothered if you asked other men for pictures?
you are experiencing new things. it is a good thing.
if not, it was not meant to be.
if he likes you for your activities, start doing things he would not like.
start talking about marriage, kids, and family, and it may scare him.
roses may be too strong.
do not run; but, tell him to slow down.
i liked jon when matt and i first became a couple; however, i did not know if he liked me as well.
hide their lunchbox and avoid them at recess.
you can most likely do much better.
that does not concern you.
also, it causes people to be more anxious and jealous, so be wary of that.
i have had this problem many times. remain with both of them but do not do anything to cause problems.
it may be too late to abort.
a lot of guys dream about the same thing.
there is nothing wrong with this, as he treated her right.
it is really upsetting how much boys love themselves.
if she like you, then she should know you are new at this.
that depends on your but who would you want to?
it is bothering me because i would like to do this with him but i also want to wait.
if you are interested in another man, you should mention that.
is it that you do not have one, or you are having trouble with the one you have?
he is not an addict or anything of the sort.
be friendly, not assertive.
he probably did not answer your calls because he was truely busy.
ast them when they are taking a lie detector test.
i like him but i do not love him.
you should go the the gym and work out, practice speing with a lower voice, and act confident.
i recommend that you be direct and candid with your friend.
you can pick someone better.
tell him that your child needs him.
i feel old as well, even though i am _num_
don't lose everything to sex.
why can they con treat us with respect?
if he is still talking to her, he is probably cheating on you or something close to it.
once she leaves him, karma will come around and it will go back to him.
i would say that in most cases, "yes."
women are not ready. you need to help.
do not ask. let him it on his own.
if i had to choose, black men. white men do not do it for me.
no, if you already broke up with her, find another woman.
how do i tell him that i am pregnant with his child without him getting very angry.
make it short and to the point.
would you like to be called names?
me and my fiance are like that.
my guy does tell me that it gives him an opportunity to tell me beautiful i am.
i also like kids, but i am not the one.
it is not just a guy thing.
well, i would not just drop my friends just because we had an argument.
do you see yourself happy for the rest of your life with this person?
consider the reason that the two of you broke up, and then move on yourself.
if you go where your penis leads you, it could be in the wrong direction.
i could please use some advice from other people.
break-up with the one that you have, she will be shocked.
also, a personality which is not too bad.
i am not of the view that women are poor liars.
although it repulses me, others get intense please from it, i suppose.
i think it may be only normal to cool off.
you need to ask yourself if you are intersted in him.
in my opinion, that does not sound like a good friend.
if you are attracted to men and women, you are bisexual.
she should have the heart, not playing with someones heart.
first, you should choose one man that you love.
men are people too, and have feelings just as women do.
i can't find any reason.
i wouldn't want my boyfriend to have lunch with another woman especially on valentine's day.
marriages break up for many reasons, like money, kids, stress, etc.
for an older child, try putt putt golf, laser tag, or go-karts.
my boyfriend and i broke up after eight years. i really did love him.
i am very mature for my age.
when you find your gem, hopefully he will want you for you.
you had an intimate interlude with her, she is the boss, and that is just that.
i do not know how to deny someone and still be friends with them.
if you do not tell him the truth you will always wonder .
go slow and steady because i am a man.
tell him when you are in private at the right moment.
if you are patient you may be rewarded.
that will show her she is important compared to your friends.
no that is not true, it should always be about the outside of a woman.
he is as clueless as i am.
i have been nice to her continuously. what else is there to do?
what kind of father does that make him?
in the event she causes you emotional pain, i don't deserve the blame. you should have neglected to obey my counsel.
i adored this man, however, subsequent to my humiliation by him in front of a _num_-person crowd, i'm unsure of my emotions!
perhaps the pair of you require a period of separation.
a simple method for communicating his desire for a mere rendezvous.
or simply enthused regarding their romantic relationship?
if he wants to be friends, then be friends.
i wonder why they have to fight.
that is all they think of.
we're not mind readers.
sometimes, men say things just to play with you.
probably because you're single and don't have a date.
if you find yourself in a mess, you have to clean the mess.
do any of the women here use the sample cosmetics at the mall?
one day surprise him with a kiss.
it depends on if he enjoys games about war, or sport, or role play.
all men do it, even when they're married.
i enjoy thinking about different men. i suppose it is alright.
but a woman will never admit it.
if you are asking this, then you love your wife.
if he does not know you, then it will be difficult but worth attempting.
brush your mouth twice and you will be fine.
because some men forget themselves when they are in the presence of attractive women such as myself.
if not, then no. if you are too young, as in twelve years old or younger, then no.
the course of action is simple: know about his/her emotions and discuss them.
yes, the money is very good but there are quite a few objects in those areas.
it depends on how things are.
you won't meet anyone serious unless you are well endowed.
i tried to converse with him, but he has yet to call me.
tell them how upset you feel.
i live in romania, you should visit!
you will wake up one day and just know.
it can work for you too.
you do not date a friends younger sister.
stay with him if you want to be with him.
let us communicate on yahoo at shrunkenmann_thegrass. females only.
she admires you and thinks of you as a friend, that is all.
i would not worry about the embarrassment factor.
yes, if you feel the need to, then send him one as well.
you have some work to do there.
have a serious talk with her and say that is childish, and that you are getting older
communication, but are you sure you want to do that?
if you can not say this to his face then scream it into the mirror with him not around.
as for what to do- do not do anything.
no, only if they are sick.
if not, you will show him how.
i am looking for a girl as pure as i am.
your mother is dating him.
he will love you more.
wait and watch what happens if you believe this will lead you to a heart break.
i believe he was a friend once.
you should state that you have enough friends.
in the first instance, she is not acting as a best friend does, and you should watch her carefully.
to find a man you may like, try yahoo personals.
you should ask him out on a date, if he is interested.
that is another story.
you are very good looking.
you can go on a cruise and push her overboard.
do not push her or confess your feelings for her.
however, it is not a bad thing if you enjoy it and it is with a responsible person.
hence, they do not think using the head on their shoulders.
believe in yourself; it is very attractive.
i have dated several bisexual females and i find it extremely attractive.
if i think hard about it, i suppose i want to be with both of them.
no, it is that he enjoys changing girlfriends occasionally.
both. if i must choose one, then "beauty for this moment."
i say that whatever your instinct tells you is happening, is really happening.
a little bit of both.
make love to a loved one.
like lumberjacks say, "have your best friend tell him for you."
yes, he is a man and that is what they do.
every time i get back, it is the same issues again.
just try to let him get to know you.
you do not understand what real problems are until you are married and have kids!
that is a lie. if you really love the person, your relationship will stay strong no matter what.
we always run into eachother, and i might like him.
he might be checking to see if you are alright.
love will be full of sweet meanings.
you can talk to me anytime.
you will feel that you can not trust men.
do not give him anything expensive.
you can believe what you want to believe.
it does not matter who she was, even if it was a stripper.
a sense of humor is very important.
he respects that i want to wait and is understanding.
i thought a boy liked me because he used to stare at me all day long.
if you have no problem with it, then it isn't a problem.
just assure her that mom and dad love each other, even though they do not live together anymore.
you will prove to be a great sister!
i guess people want what they cannot have.
you can be attracted to whomever.
you should tell her to wait.
tell your partner and understand him because it will help you to help each other.
my husband and i got married on july _num_, _num_ and went to hawaii for two weeks!
if you are not the sex will be dry and hurt.
what do i do with the two of them?
if you do not love it, i would say no.
there are some men who do not care what they look like.
where do you want it to go?
perhaps it is because he is not lonely.
if you have done so and he continues, then let him leave. you do not need that.
how much success you achieve in your life, and love tends to be the reason for that success.
try being the woman, then i am sure you will find one.
does anybody know what "love" is anymore?
you just use the restroom from there, and did not even wipe yourself?!
if you break up with a guy, and he is not completely desperate, he probably will not ask you out again.
we try to make the ladies feel as comfortable as possible.
if i see you with another woman, i might just do something drastically crazy!
if you have to ask questions of that nature, then, you should go out and get that job.
reflect on his personality, is he a nice, decent person?
i have a friend who has her clitoris pierced.
how would i approach another woman, and invite her to my and my boyfriend's home.
everything that has been said is true.
i don't care if you're inexperienced, if you are too open i don't want to be with you.
tell her in the middle of a conversation spontaneously.
it means that he really cherishes you.
true love will fin you anywhere as long as you're honest.
see if she emails you back or you can find out in person.
it is easier to move on then to retaliate.
if you are a liar, you will never get anywhere in life.
dogs are like family members.
if your heart says run, you need to run.
of course, stop by and say hello!
find another adult, perhaps a grandparent, if they are hurting themselves too much to listen to you.
i knew a woman who was married to a jerk, who beat their kids.
because they have a guilty conscience.
after the police left, the dog was in custody and the children were back in bed.
stop doing this if she is not willing.
i certainly would like to speak to someone.
yes, you are a complete stranger to me.
i don't think most men are daft.
if you are a woman and have feelings for another woman, you're a lesbian.
even if what he says is true, why would me message other women asking for salacious photos?
i love my ex still.
don't tell him first, ask your mother, or social worker, and let them speak to your parents.
it is not as difficult as it seems if you have the proper training.
if it is true love, then he will wait for you and not cheat on you.
if you can make them laugh, they will love you.
such mean are not worth your time or trouble.
it is not worth your time unless you enjoy being treated poorly.
i wouldn't like to be the _num_ man on her list.
i am turning _num_ on august _num_, _num_
this is the love most people want, you are too lazy to go after it.
they may have known you would be upset.
talk to her, and see if she has feelings towards you.
that is a very good way to begin the day.
i gave him a second chance but he did not take it.
if she wants to, then she will when she is available.
lights on and on top is attractive.
be a friend and give him some space.
you are beginning to hate the male and female friends of the one you love.
do something that most people have not.
i do not believe that love perishes so quickly.
fine, i believe it is merely no matter.
she is most likely still abiding with her parents.
this is quite an egregious negative situation.
she obviously does since she is still with you.
i would not worry about such things.
it sounds as if he is playing hard to get, and you are not.
i do not believe even chickens care about that.
you receive back what you put in.
use soap to smell better.
forget about him, instead, think about how much better off you are because of the fact that you are not in a relationship with him.
what can i say to her in order to encourage her to lose weight?
leave this man, he is not worth the time you would put into the relationship.
many forms of attention and to be fed some delicious chocolate.
send him away if he gets too possessive.
it is when you can hear each other without speaking.
you should try it some time as you will not be disappointed.
i mean it is so insensitive of her to do those things in front of you.
other than that, go to a party and pick up drunk women.
ask him, it might be awkward, but it will be worth it if he does indeed love you.
say i love you, if it is meant to be, it will come out.
it will pay off in the long run.
i am always falling for bad boys. what is my problem?
would i pack my husband's belongings?
in that case, yo do not have a relationship.
why does my former boyfriend continue attempting to arouse jealousy?
my best friend is a man and we have never attempted to be more than friends.
in my case, though, i did not.
go shopping with her if she wants.
he has a girlfriend.
if you love him tell him.
my dad is like that.
he needs to mature.
i am not asking him to go out or anything even close to that.
the number one thing is that boys do not really mean what they say.
just find another girl because she does not love you.
marrying the lady of my dreams would that mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
i will really get to know her.
i want to be aingle again. i am currently married with one child.
if you are that upset, you should find soemone new.
you should find someone that will listen to you first before other people.
you have to be over _num_
he asked me how i was doing.
you already had sex with this man.
you can apologize, but you need to accept what you already decided.
watch an adult movie together.
after that, ask the woman why she does not like you.
but she has a boyfriend, so do not attempt to court her.
but yes, it could work if you want it to work.
it is too late. you missed your chance and she has moved on to someone else.
you know you are in love if you have intercourse with them.
because i am in your school.
women, go ahead and tell him.
be patient and do not rush yourself.
i once heard that it was not.
also, avoid the plants i mentioned.
people are not always intelligent.
it could never be boring.
i have been with my husband since i was _num_, and i am _num_ next month.
do not buy a woman lingere unless it is something that she wants.
i do not think that it is a bad choice.
i asked her to dance and we are now friends.
either that or you can try to find his alternate ego and accept all of him.
he must go if he cannot respect you.
whether my friends agree or not, they will never have a better friend than me.
show him what you like instead of just telling him.
it will happen again if you find her.
you do know what they are taking advantage of you, right?
you are not sure, so you do not know if it is worth it.
i would marry your cat, just to get in the family.
you drew them in with your affection.
i am here, all you have to do is ask.
have intercourse any and everywhere.
good luck, you are going to need it.
it is not right, is it legal?
my sister has broken up with him since then, but now she is pregnant with his baby.
a woman knows what a woman wants, right?
he even slept with his best friends' wife.
do you enjoy hurting those who mean the most to you?
it is up to you to decide to not be miserable anymore.
i wouldn't want or need anything else.
an event that happened behind your back.
be a friend to a woman first.
he probably will not tell you, but he is most likely to tell someone else.
when you are into a relationship, and if you go out for fun, this kills your partner.
he is a jerk and i never want to see him again.
she might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around, but she can not fake that.
maybe you have but you do not know it.
do not go overboard with your planning.
we get along well except for this issue.
is it time to move on to a different place?
tell him or your friends that i know him and they might know.
tell him that you are a beautiful vampire.
the coaches were very calm, and i played more than half of the game.
that left us no choice but to part, i never stopped loving him.
start by expressing where you want to kiss them, and then kiss them in those areas, like the nose, cheek, neck, etc.
don't tell him that you want to have intercourse.
i am note sure, are you in love now?
that wait will be worth it.
you should not give him another chance to hurt you.
he will find that with another person. you want something more.
either you need to break up with them, or make them want to break up with you.
he will be heartbroken, but will get over it.
you should not be with anyone who forces you to do things that you do not want to.
some guys that have experience still make mistakes.
math men know how to handle curves.
you have to overdose on the stuff to stop the habit.
have you tried hard?
i am curious what that was about?
a high class strip bar with plenty of alcohol.
yes i would do that in a split second.
this is not the place to find one.
yes, if you begin removing yourself off that chair.
but that also depends on your personality.
yes, mine at least live.
if you never try to have a relationship, you will never what might have happened between the two of you.
i have never heard of a man who did not like this.
obviously, if he is trying so hard to frighten you, he does not really care about you.
this is not something that should be accomplished through e-mail.
why did you post such a stereotypical, ignorant, and pointless question?
i want her to realize what will happen before something bad happens.
that is not fair to the man you are with now.
i want a man to be true to himself.
is it just too weird and geeky!
wow, what a situation, good luck with that!
is not bad, if you like him.
he could just be using you for just sex.
i am sorry if you love him, wait, you said you did not, anywho, leave him please!
you have the right to be mad.
send him a post card from bora bora.
take a chance and tell her.
does it matter since you received yours?
i wholeheartedly agree with you.
that is a hard face to go with.
i have asked her twice to be my girlfriend; but, she has not yet answered.
you do not have anything better to do with your life other than attempting to understand them?
yes, i care, but that is not everything.
i am _num_ years old and just got a girlfriend.
just tell him that you love him and ask him to be your boyfriend.
no, this is not bad at all.
you already know a lot about each other.
i will never speak ill of another.
you're confusing me, one question at a time.
cheat on her with a sex worker, they are experienced.
women can have them as well.
don't use intercourse as a weapon in your married life.
this way you can experience other women without cheating.
what happened to his queen?
maybe, but i will never find him.
do not do it in private.
who cares what their gender is?
i shower, wear deodorant, and always have fresh breath.
it does not matter if you are wearing a skirt, heels, or a pair of baggy jeans.
go back to what you were doing.
he used to mentally and physically abuse me.
i have gone out with large men.
do you have a chicken rear end?
if you like her, ask her out, and see where that takes you.
tell him that you do not like that guy.
a guy does not want to be just friends with a woman.
what do you think about marraige?
i will not date a large man.
stay out of this until time calms them down.
where can i find sex and candy?
it is better to lose a lover than to love a looser.
i move on if a man does that to me.
i found that it is best to go out with a friend.
do not do anything that you do not want to.
there is no way to know, according to gab.
as a forty year old woman, you should look for someone around your age.
women do not like it when they are "pushed."
why not call her or send her a valentine's day card?
you may lose the person who you love to someone else.
my best friend went on a date with a very short man and they kissed.
i am thirty-eight years old. would anybody lie about that age?
what, exactly, do men want from women?
i asked my ex-spouse the same question last night when we talked.
if he is a good man, he will understand. if he likes you, he will probably stop.
here is one last piece of advice: trust her.
surprise him. you can do it.
wait. perhaps it is not yet time for you to meet the right person.
no, it is not normal. it is abnormal.
i am confused. what are you asking?
if he cared about you, he would not have looked at the other girl.
i would like to have you next to me.
i would not date someone again after we broke up.
why do married or men in committed relationships cheat?
after all, she has lived her entire life these days just for you.
where in the world do you live?
it seems that from you statement, you're just living in a fantasy.
who can help me get myself together.
you should ask someone you trust, or doctor.
anyone who loves you should consider your feelings as well.
how much does the child's father participate?
you should not have sexual relations with your cousin.
my girlfriend is my love and my everything; she is perfect.
males can have female friends as well.
you may even discover that you do not like having sex with women at all.
i think the word stupid exceeds dumb.
once they are interested then the chase is over.
why would date someone that young or old?
some men's rear ends are adorable.
if he is trying to control you, break up with him.
if you truly enjoy a person's company, then why not give them a try?
no, she hatefully broke up with me. i do not even care about her, anymore.
no, i doubt it. i am positive.
i believe "no answer" is your answer. you do not want to admit it.
what are you worried about?
the answer is no if you are a teen or a kid.
pick them up at mignight, and go to wendy's.
i love the father of my child.
bear in mind that the man has not been in a relationship for nearly nine years.
you should read the article and say what it takes so you can stop her.
who is on your mind?
men are happy, keep sex interesting and exciting. he will never consider it.
explain to them, that they should be understanding, and supportive continuously.
i am his friend, i love him, but he doesn't have the slightest idea.
do you take issue with this?
start step _num_ if you don't see any results after _num_ weeks.
do you want to video chat?
the guy is married.
there is usually one who is not as good in bed as the other.
it is never boring. it is fulfilling.
on top of the covers with the lights off and a few candles lit.
yes you can. did you miss the day they mentioned that in sexual education class?
here, take it, but do not take it for granted.
if they do not, then they are not worth you caring what they think.
but why would he ignore me?
i think a man with a nice round bottom is sexy.
i have men friends who are like brothers to me and there is no tension whatsoever.
i hear a coat vacuum will take care of it.
i expect that you will make a good impression on this girl.
throw a party and invite all your girlfriends. there she can mingle with new people.
your level of worry is apparent in the way you are spelling words.
it sounds like you are very sexy. that bodes well.
nobody can do this better than you.
you are such green minded people.
remember that many married men are very happy.
but do not ask, "are you a virgin?"
yes, i have the same problem, therefore i understand what you mean.
i am sorry this degenerate said that about you. the rest of us believe that you are very good.
do not bother yourself with what anyone else wants.
what do you want to do now?
you need to learn how to understand people, do you understand?
a guys says, "i am a caveman.", the girl responds, "what is this?"
yes, get rid of the cat.
get it over with and simply text him.
my man-ego cannot handle a woman knowing about it.
if you have money to spend, women love jewelry.
does she like the beach, or maybe a weekend in the bahamas?
that is my opinion.
if you do not like the guys that asked you out, just say no.
you might get some tips if you watch a woman.
set up a dinner date with her.
you will get pregnant if you do not take precaution.
he is ignoring you for the same reason that we ignore you.
i noticed that outside too.
i am _num_ years old and almost handsome.
tell her to try to ask him to go out with her or something.
your questions are making people be aware that you are single.
the bro code states that it is always bro's over females, and the saying still holds up 'til this day.
i would not give up all of my time to myself, for a friend or family member, personal time is precious.
people do not seem to care anymore about others.
tell him it is your way, or you will not listen.
you need to call and be done with it.
out your nose there.
she just is not that into you.
my love lives far away from me
what are you doing?
do not let her play games with you.
it cannot be love because you do not know anything about her.
it is easier and much better to tell over the phone or in person.
you will not find love on the internet.
you can not make your life all about her.
you should take her out for a date.
tell them you already have a date, and they should have asked earlier.
that is _num_ points for each of us.
i once said, "well, since we have nothing better to do."
she may have an underlying reason for eating like that.
if she is pregnant, then you should end the procedure.
you are a sly one, i was just going to ask this.
that is probably the one thing that comes before a person's health.
women enjoy being pampered. take her to dinner or order candles or flowers. treat her as though she were a queen.
i believe so, for romantic love. it is also very enjoyable.
what do you think?
not special or strange, merely your personal choice.
can you please look into it for me?
how do you get your man to back off the woman?
i went to one with a belly dancer, and it was not cool.
she already knows it is not love.
i would not worry about the heroin.
i enjoy laughing and telling jokes.
it cannot be done. if they care about you, it is going to hurt no matter how you say it.
what do you enjoy doing?
someone else may take the opportunity, do not be late.
if they're not why would they be so cruel?
start cutting him off, so when you get married he will be used to it.
say i love you, and it will throw them off guard.
he obviously doesn't accept you for who you are, so why stay with him and miserable.
i believe that will happen, why not?
once you cross the friendship line, it is very hard to go back to that.
i think that boys are more sensitive, yet girls show it more.
get a life and relax.
go ahead and text.
do not stick with someone who is not right for you. it is just not worth it.
it is too commercialized, so do not believe it all.
is he using you?
one might be good sexually, the other might be a good listener.
you have to do it, or shes will be upset.
it is what you make of the situation.
why is he sleeping outside with the dog?
do you dream about her at night?
i suppose you merely need to circulate through places and activities which you enjoy, start a conversation, and see what happens.
no, i do not want to shake your hand, either.
if you are in love, then you want nothing else.
i love you, a lot.
pick yourself up, do not let it bother you, and have fun while you date other people.
i believe she likes me because of the flirting and the way we talk to one another.
relax and do it. i think that is not the best point in your life.
it would not matter how she looks.
being eight years old is not very enjoyable, is it?
he will ask you to marry him.
then go ask her on a date.
you are a little vague with the information you shared.
i have many male friends, but also many female friends.
and i hope things turn out well.
use a calm tone when answering from now on.
when they get married they start acting stupid.
chances are very slim.
what's the worst thing that can happen?
and my guess is that you may not want to have phone sex with him and he wants you to do that.
are you implying that i am not a good person?
did you just read what you wrote?
and, trust me, values and priorities are big things to look for!
they do not see them, but they feel them.
this is imperative if you're going to get married, and start a family.
i took my neighbor to the doctor at _num_ last night, after i returned from work.
please her in the bedroom as well.
tell her that you need a hug every once in a while.
if a guy did not really care, he would not give a one iota.
no offense to large posteriors, but it was a man.
trust me, you cannot change them.
it depends. you must first ask him.
there is no way to know whether or not she is a virgin until you have intercourse with her. therefore, you should do it soon.
satisfy yourself, but be careful. use protection.
some men just need a little extraatimulation.
i tell my guy i love him everyday.
what is a girl going to do?
all men love to compete.
you elope with the person you can't stand to live without.
would you like to date men or women?
i believe intercourse is for satisfaction of both partners.
adam and eve were smart creatures.
do men not always worry about intercourse?
if you do inspire her to impress you, then you do not look the same to her.
it is hard to say; try flirting with girls.
i believe there is hope.
as your a girl, it will be easy to find a new boyfriend.
you need the right guy.
if she is right for you or not, her response will tell you everything!
if you cannot do the time taking care of the baby, then, do not do the crime of passion!
well, i would believe in what the girl told you.
comment on her hair, outfit, or shoes if you are fairly attractive.
decide where you are going to live once you talk to her.
loving someone of the opposite sex is a sin, there are a lot of sinners living on earth at the moment!
friends with benefits do not have the same meaning for all men and women.
at least he wants you to be around to be involved in it!
does it seem like they think he does not have much confidence in himself?
i love my sister very much but she often enters harmful relationships.
you do not know. that is why they call it "love." it is confusing, is it not?
he even accepted my newborn daughter as his own.
if you want your husband to pay attention to you, then you must utilize food and coitus.
the upside down kiss in spider-man caught him off guard.
get one as thick as you want.
you will get pleasure form it.
you should make it elaborate and in public to show her how much she means to you.
if you are attracted to men, you might be bisexual.
you have been hanging around the wrong women.
never hide, you might lose them.
if you are shy, just tell him to close his eyes.
who needs good looks if he has a wild streak?
i would go with jamookae, he has serious emotional problems!
and you may have already frightened her.
allow me to guess: move to new zealand?
tell him that you are in charge, or break up with him and get another man in your life.
personality is more important, then being fit (not necessarily thin) and kind.
we are all strange around here.
your mother was wrong in whom she kicked out.
do not sleep together if you have not already.
thirteen years of age is a good time to have a boyfriend; but actually going out on dates is more appropriate at sixteen.
i see the way he looks and acts towards you.
my father lost about _num_ pounds just playing outside.
if things do not work out, leave them as they were and begin going in a different direction.
no, why is it a man cannot talk to another woman without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
it means just what she says.
now i am _num_-years-old and single.
far enough to be away from family, but close enough so they can visit maybe once a month?
say hi and then have a casual conversation with him.
they need to compete to be the meanest person.
who knows what a woman is doing when she is not with you. you either trust her or leave her.
do not hold anything back.
i am trying to think about what is on my mind.
i do not like the word 'stupid.'
my ex said the same thing.
a dance is only a dance.
you have a boyfriend that loves you. and you love him.
it is painful when you have sex.
go to a nice vacation resort.
only if it feels right to you.
you seem like a really sweet person, but, you can find better!
my guess is about _num_ to _num_ hundred.
i am just too busy to respond to that.
all men do not function on the same level.
of course she yelled about it then.
i am telling you, it was very long.
tell your lover how special they are to you and why.
i made it and so can you.
i would be worried if they dodge the question and/or get angry.
i suppose you have tried talking to him, correct?
many women appreciate it when you make eye contact.
yes, find another boyfriend. there seem to be many lonely people in the world. move on with your life.
i have a mix between the two.
school is fun around the time you are in sixth grade.
you should remember the good times and forget the bad, but it may take some time.
i suggest that you introduce yourself.
she deserves credit for sticking with it even when she finds it upsetting.
at one time i experienced a similar event.
you are the only attractive person that i see.
how can i tell if the man i am with loves me?
it looks funny if the girl is significantly taller then the guy.
somewhere deep down there is an attraction.
why on earth would someone do something like that and tell everyone about it?
does it make someone unattractive if they are not asked out on a date?
love ends up finding you, so please do not rush things.
my problem is that i make girls angry because i am more intelligent than they are.
you know what he is doing but you do not care, because you allow him to tell you differently.
in my opinion, it depends on how mature the child is.
my advice is to think deeply about it.
also, tell your boyfriend why you hated him.
i understand that you do not consider her attractive, but she is happy with her own feelings.
i can fall in love after a single month.
it is similar to suicide: normal to consider, but not to do.
you need to find someone else. and stop stalking them.
i do not want him as my boyfriend anymore.
how can i tell him?
that person is just bad news.
i like thick guys.
have fun or keep yourself busy.
how do i check if i am madly in love with her?
you can do many things.
men like my butt and always whistle at it.
someone is tracking his every step.
if you see what she has to say, you will have your answer.
is he ruining his life?
someone is out there.
if they are loved, they would not find it.
it will bring him down and likely he will not want to be intimate with you, again.
i see you have decided to leave your wife.
there is something missing from their relationship, because they are not happy.
they still want to have sex with you.
i would never pack my husbands bag.
this will happen, if you really love her.
it is not so simple with kids.
most people do not beleive in love untill they fall in love.
it is a good thing if you can laugh at yourself.
have a good day.
ask him if he would like to go somewhere with you.
also me. i am mexican, though not mixed.
i know it is difficult, but it is better for you.
it depends on your age.
she is either not interested or you are too overbearing.
do not do anything you will regret later.
i am sorry but i do not know where to find him.
and there are a lot of other men on this planet.
no, unless you have some doubt about that.
they do not appeal to me at all.
it is odd that a young person is here answering the questions.
it will cost you three points for each answer.
why does it matter to you?
if you want drunks, make it byob.
see, marriage is not fun and games.
perhaps their husbands are not good enough.
can you find out if he is cheating on you?
have the two of you gone out with your parents?
a woman wants to date and honest guy.
i am _num_ how old are you?
it is wet and intersting. it is better if it is forbidden.
you can say anything, but the important matter is whether it is true.
he does not want to use a condom.
he ended your relationship because of something someone else said.
are you sure that she loves you?
you do not know if it is real love.
being good all the time is quite boring.
step one: do it five times a day.
you just like the sight of yourself, so you are perhaps a little narcissistic, but probably not homosexual.
if he does not, then kick his read end.
you are jealous of those other people holding hands and making out because you cannot get a man.
my grandma tells this story better.
i see him once in a while, and i made the correct decision.
you forgot to bring some for me.
why did they not tell you that.
only if the woman did not care if i slept with other women.
the more you think about her, the more you want her.
ask her to be your date to the dance.
find a girl that shares common interests with you.
he has a small phallus.
no lie, but, that is disgusting.
leave her and move on.
it happens where friends try and date and it does not work out.
the customer care team removed that topic.
it is a way to show you that she does not want to attract any other guys.
i do not know, if i were you, i would ask her whether or not she likes you.
just be yourself and like the first guy said, a little money won't hurt anyone.
do you think she should ask the guy?
yes, the posterior is an important physical feature on a guy that makes him attractive.
the first kiss made me lightheaded for a second.
if he says yes, then he is being unfaithful.
yes, so that i can do the same to her.
no, not unless they specifically said that it is no longer cancelled.
don't make it look like you are commenting negatively about her weight, she will shut down, and consume more food.
the person who said that women only commit because of money, is wrong.
any chance they'd like each other?
be yourself, and if they don't like you, they don't deserve you.
your daughter is your first priority in all aspects of life.
he broke up with me after a few days.
someone you love will always be there whether you are happy or sad.
what should i do? stay, or, go?
things will be better.
it might scare men away if you are clingy after sex.
you should avoid falling totally in love with him.
that is very sad; where do you live?
if you do not mind being her second choice, then it would be fine.
i would like for you do do what is best and right even though it may be painful.
some women like to please their man, so no one else does.
you're creating the problems with him.
i think being playfully difficult is the best strategy.
there are homophobes present.
i want to be respected, and i would like him to be kind.
anyone who does not understand it has been brainwashed.
i stopped a child who was running across the street in the rain from jay walking.
i think that it is very important.
you need to ask him directly if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.
be yourself and move on if she does not like you because you are still young.
no. enter reality, this is not a place to communicate freely.
you will find the person who you can love.
intercourse. you do not have to kiss, but you must have intercourse.
remove the cat, steam clean the carpet, the furnitue, and the bed linen, and spray for ticks and fleas.
alas, gaze at those girls in the eye, and do not look away.
he believes she would not be unfaithful to him, but merely despises the thought of which causes him to be paranoid.
it genuinely depends on the situation.
embracing him was most likely not the best of solutions.
stop letting your husband be such a slacker!
yes, you could fall in love after _num_ months trust me it has happened to me.
just kidding he says, as he throws a banana at the screen and scratches head.
go and have your breast treated and get them reduced and look sexy.
if they love each other, then they will live together.
in the future, please do not ask such imbecilic questions.
my friend always teases me for who i am.
move on, time is of the essence.
ask her is she will have intercourse with anyone.
and she does not want anyone else to say anything.
this one time i did propose to her, and she did say yes!
you will never know until you try to flirt with him!
congratulations to the bride and groom, she is a lucky girl!
it seems like you do not want this, or else you would be asking about it.
he does not have enough affections for her to want to leave his wife.
all i believe is that i agree with you.
but, i have my own ideas and opinions as well.
having sexual intercourse is like business, while the process of making love is more fun.
say a prayer to help guide you to the best possibilities, and people will always come and go in your life.
love is not that hard to find so do not worry and, do not be a jerk ok?
if he answers no then he is cheating.
i was talking with a man for two hours.
not merely honest, but also honorable. i do not commit infidelity or pretend to care.
and he broke up with me.
tell him what you want.
be honest with yourself and who you are.
it is a sexual story as well.
you are not on jerry springer.
it is easier said then done.
if you fell in love with a woman, would it be for her personality?
do you mean how are you?
the world is full of men.
it probably is discomforting for him.
if that is the case, why can it not be achieved?
the answer is that life is good.
if he is doing it voluntarily, he should be questions and closely watched.
i miss him and if anyone knows him, please send me an email.
ask her if she likes you.
when he is around do not go to your best friend's house unless she is with you.
you should continue if you like him.
do not spend a lot of money.
protect yourself from getting pregnant if you are not ready to become a mother.
start from the day of your wedding.
forget the instant messages, call him at his house.
also, do not listen to these women.
yes, you should tell him to leave.
if she broke up with you for being yourself then yes.
phone sex is an alternative from having physical intercourse.
marry her, and then go to court.
wherever you go, treat her with the utmost respect.
if you're a women, you should dress and act like a woman.
guys tell me that i am pretty.
they have dieases, so they are not good to have around babies.
you should write him a note.
you can travel to the uk and find the answer.
i am married, therefore i know.
no, because it overly complicates matters.
i do not know. why are you asking me?
if you make each other happy then, then do what you know.
he is the one who does not love you.
in my opinion, any younger than fourteen or fifteen years is foolish.
that is how you know. it comes to you, then you will know.
if not, then remain with your sister.
first of all, are you male, female, or something else?
well, that is just like me two years ago.
it is to show their appreciation and to let it be known that they care about you and think about you.
we are married but still she cannot conceive, so please advise me.
i would tell him directly as he probably will not care anyway.
it is what's inside that counts.
maybe she doesn't feel the need to show him off the way she used to.
he enjoys flirting, and he is an attractive man.
if you are interested in him, why do you find him so strange?
leave the people alone.
please tell me the possibility to be pregnant in this situation.
there is hot and awesome guys that weigh over two hundred and fifty!
take a hint, she does not want you.
a man can work from sun to sun, but a women's job is never done!
many men are, but not all.
you are an authentic threat, you are just unaware of that fact.
i would have to agree with sixteen.
of course i would go. i do not have to be muslim to attend such a wedding!
oh god, try talking to him first.
send me some more information if you need help.
i am sorry i am not help, but we can still talk about it if you'd like.
yes it is possible to fall in love after four months.
tell your friend to send the message to that boy, that you like him.
i think you should since women feel mature for their age.
you cannot take the baby back.
do not feel bad about still having your innocence.
although you should be an incentive, i guess he needs a different one.
another woman is interested in the same man as i am, and i feel as though i have no chance with him.
the same as she did to you.
everything. a woman wants everything from a man.
i am in junior high and he is in high school but he is a junior.
or you could ask him.
a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
and you merely want to be genuine.
when you are both nude and in the same bed.
but it must be your decision.
most of the time i consider it and realize that it is my choice.
what is the opposite of "above me"?
how about all women who are unfaithful?
many of my friends' girlfriends ask me this question.
but i agree that the man about whom you were asking is a dog.
i know it feels bad now, but you will forget about him.
whatever you do, make sure you are not caught up in their disputes.
i am taken aback by the size of your ego.
are you teasing me at the moment?
if you are in love you will never feel bored if it is true love.
i do not want her to die.
be careful when you do it.
would i put myself in danger for a friend or stranger?
i would be very disappointed if i got taht same kiss today.
neither of us could think of anything better to do.
i would like to be done with work.
flirt with him, and tell him you love him.
it is something that might lead to love.
you need to do it before he leaves ot when you see him next.
we would go for a walk and then she would whine about something.
in all likelihood the answer is "no" because he does not really know her if they me online.
either he loves you or he does not.
from the sound of it, he already has a girlfriend.
no, it is not boring to fall in love.
simply because you put only _num_ percent of your effort into it.
instinctively, i am going to say yes.
a nice wedding in the yard worked for me.
i do not think i have a bad butt.
she might like you only as friend.
you should wait, so she does not have a reason to hate you.
sometimes even the brightest people can be dumb.
this past saturday, i had to pretend to be a shemale quite a bit.
i think it is mixed.
it did not work after i tried it.
if you go down the road and bail on him later, that would truly be awful.
if you are under the age of _num_ years old, and still in school, you should not have sexual relations.
she will break it off to make a move.
hive her one in front of everybody and see what she does.
he is marrying a woman, correct?
perhaps someday they will be convinced.
if you know anyone that can bake a cake, then there is your answer.
so, shall i tell my significant other that i do not enjoy his companionship?
why did you first leave home?
leave him and he will realize how good you were to him.
i do not like skinny women.
i am not on the list.
women can be friends, but men cannot.
it is when she is not asking you for intimacy, anymore.
it is at least the way i would get her.
or, like what you did for your class?
it is exciting, especially when you have butterflies in your stomach!
two months if you want to go in the poor house.
it does not mean anything is wrong with you if everyone is dating while you are not.
lol is an abbreviation for laughing out loud.
the more that you keep giving him, the more he is going to take.
i think infatuation only lasts for months.
depend on the woman because she will do it if she likes your bottom.
i would not only want it one time.
every man will like different things about a woman.
do not make it look like you want her to be someone else.
it is about the money.
he will be happy.
men are moe tough then they are strong.
is she better looking then me?
i would like to help, but i am too lazy to read the question.
do not try to ignore it or pretend not to care.
it is very painful. it is better to wait until after you are married to do that.
i am twenty-five years old. are you serious about your age?
you are not one who she would normally like and i believe she is the same for you.
be true to yourself and do not let him use you.
do you find them sick or wonderful?
they boys are jealous because you like him and not me.
if you really like her, then it should not matter.
those given out of the blue are truly from the heart.
this girl at my school is very nice.
please recommend any that you know of, thank you.
no offense to any good men in the world.
i always argue with my mother's boyfriend.
we are not getting younger. that is the adventure of life.
i have been spending time with a very attractive man and we have been becoming better friends every day.
stand on a chair or walk with stilts.
if you like sports, play volleyball or baseball or whatever.
he loves me and he would never cheat on me.
i am sorry if i did not get the point.
or, if you are too shy, get involved in activities she likes even if they are not your favorite.
she sees how happy you are and realizes what she has thrown away.
start to compliment him on how he looks!
the gown and the bridesmaids' dresses could take you a month to choose on their own!
it may have been communicated in the same manner as you informed us.
you daughter is behaving immaturely, and you should tell her so and then refrain from further comments.
he did not think about you at all.
i do not believe they will go to heaven.
it depends on many factors, such as mood.
i am a man. would you like to go on a date with me?
good luck. i hope he understands and asks you on a date.
allow things to continue as they are.
you need to sign another one with each other every day.
the only reason i did it was because i did not want him to feel lonely.
i have a friend who shops there for that exact reason.
you should think about what it makes you look like to his friends.
do a good deed everyday.
you are right. you did the right thing.
i have not done what. i would start laughing, or get distracted.
i would not want my wife to have a sexual affair.
you only need one girl to like you.
always stand up for yourself.
there are many girls here in the philippines who have met someone online and gotten married.
if he jokes about liking you, then forget him!
we have three children under five years old, so i cannot play with him for very long.
my man works out so he has a nice bottom.
looking at and courting other women is not fine.
ask your sister and she should give you a suitable answer.
i have the same problem.
it is not necessary, but very helpful.
if you no longer care about him, it is obvious.
i think you need to talk with your cousin.
in my opinion, it would be interesting.
women are different, as are men.
i know many decent men.
a woman who is perverse but not promiscuous, do you understand?
probably so you could not stay away from each other for long.
it depends, though, when you are older.
you say you are sexually attractive and possess good style, correct?
you are living in a fantasy world.
i have a lot of thoughts while i am goign to bed.
that girl is using you, do not marry her.
most of the girls at your school do not like him.
i am glad i married him.
my mom very important to my dad.
you should not ever fall for that.
some _num_-year-old men are good-looking, but you should look for younger men.
the girl you like is going to be alone and she does not like that.
then, he tried to kill himself and i went to see him in the hospital.
kiss the man in front of that woman.
if you go on dates with bad people, you will marry a bad person.
but this depends on her.
a woman can be attractive no matter her size.
one way or another, she is going to find out that we were together.
only if he wants to be friends.
she is manipulative and wants someone she can toy with.
after, you can do whatever you desire.
sometimes even a smart woman can go for a man who isn't nearly as smart as her.
you can not do what you are asking
most men are liars and cheaters
do you chat through yahoo
be yourself, confident, and honest. if it is not meant to be then so be it.
that is the best way to find out.
i am saying this in the friendliest way possible.
falling in love, real love, is magical... until reality sets in.
there is no better way than to tell him frankly, but tenderly.
thirty is young to be gaining a lot of weight.
i am a male so it must be sex.
he is not into toys or anything strange.
when he starts to see someone else.
in that case, what ought i do for her?
hello _num_ it is not only for lovers.
when you are truly in love then you would do anything and everything for that person.
it is dependent upon whether or not you still care for her.
do not pretend to be someone you are not.
you will not receive a positive response.
casually place it out there.
love is caring for someone or something.
that song is stuck in my head.
you should let him know how you feel and, if he is still can't find time, simply move on.
it is, however, very difficult to avoid.
i find a hairy chest and chin to be attractive.
if i did not have children, i would die for the one i love.
he is very kind but i am uncertain about his mental abilities at times.
when you enter her mind and know everything.
perhaps. there is a _num_ chance that she does, and _num_ chance that she does not.
there is nothing wrong with this. does he also join in? if there are three together then it is fine, otherwise no.
what kind of girlfriend is she? how are you trying to repair the trust?
i know quitting the school team was a good decision.
or perhaps you love that person?
i hope it ends well, whether you find your loved one or find a new loved one.
if you do not trust him, then how can you love each other?
there is still hope for these young women.
yes, you are merely confused and do not know what you want right now.
my apologies, but the magic _num_ ball says, "no."
however, he ignores me whenever i send him a message.
love is not frightening. if it is, then it is not love. you have not met the right man yet. good luck.
no, that is not strange in my opinion.
open your mouth and say something.
i'm many times stronger than the average man.
if you truly love him. then please do.
get out of the relationship. then continue with your life.
those are very difficult emotions.
i just reintroduced myself to the primary man of my heart. we spoke honestly. guilty conscience is the greatest reason to attain gifts.
there is someone out there for you.
i hope you two end up together.
i am falling in love.
no matter what you decide, you need to stop giving in and having sex.
he might be sensitive or waiting for the right woman.
the gentleman my friend likes claims that he would like to get to know her better.
you will not require special shoes.
he said he does not love you?
behave yourself as i do not think your behavior now is appropriate.
if they truly love you, they will accept you.
you sure did make the right choice!
all you have to do is walk up to her and ask her, "do you like me?"
why can't you just do this one thing?
if it is worth it to you, then i supposed you could try it.
if killing himself is what is going to take for him to get over this, then so be it.
keep quiet, why hurt his feelings?
if you cannot do that, then maybe you can e-mail him.
i am humbly stating, "i have all of the above qualities."
tell him directly: it is better to hurt him now that later.
it does not, however, do anything with you.
he is very attracted to you.
she enjoys dyeing her hair different colors.
i believe that women also do it.
do married women still preform oral sex?
you will get married as soon as you decide you want to.
some guys are like that.
that is a narrow way of thinking about sex.
when i frist saw that word, my friend told me what it meant.
when will se see the truth?
do not have kids if you want to have more time for sex.
how about going up to her and asking her.
how can i handle this situation?
you know how i overcame it?
try to just ask straight forward.
does this sound familiar?
you might want ot take a break from sex.
what you are saying is correct.
tell her to not date bad guys.
it is penis inside us that makes us women happy.
you did not say if your wife had children.
a few hours ago i was offered a chance to spend the night at a woman's place that i know.
tell him that you love him.
i hate wearing flats and i won't do it just to make a guy feel better.
you have to want to let go and move on or you will not be able to.
act yourself, just keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together!
no, but that would be funny because i am six foot two inches.
no matter how long it will take to let them go.
if he still does not, then try merely being his friend.
does he care about issues that relate to you or not?
men are hunters, just like dogs. they enjoy the hunt but prefer the chase. so run.
he wants you to do this so that he will feel comfortable being unfaithful as well.
i wear spectacles and i have been in relationships.
women liking women is very common. some grow to like it more than others, some let it fade over time.
i do not, but homer simpson is attractive.
i already said that.
men think with their penises and they get bored.
you cannot stop thinking about the person you are in love with.
we only get blown four times a week.
thank you for helping me plan my wedding!
yes because women love when you are obtuse.
inform him where you would like it placed.
see what gets you more interested.
you did not mention your age. anyway, ask him to marry you first, then consider having children.
when she is lazy during intercourse.
they are very beautiful and lovely.
god is happy when two people love each other, regardless of their genders.
if she is fine with her appearance, then you should support her.
that would be true unless i discovered that i did not want it after all.
if only i knew who she was, i could help.
i suggest that you not get serious about getting serious.
he did it once. did he do it again?
you have somebody with whom to share both your good and your bad moments.
what will happen if i break up with my boyfriend?
there is not a free lunch or fireworks.
if you do not try, you will never talk to him again.
a lot of good looking men are vain.
you not date anyone _num_ to _num_ years older than you.
it depends on our mood that day.
i talk alot using yahoo! chat.
you will loose it if you do not use it.
i don't know how you personally feel about it, but i feel uncomfortable.
save your broken heart, and find someone who will treat your heart right.
i quit and joined the rec team, it was much more enjoyable.
if he is married, you shouldn't even dare to be a friend to him.
if she asks me, i do not know the answer.
yes, i have gotten a lot of chances.
i agree with you on this, because i am going through the same thing, right now.
hang in there enough to she does not think you are not intelligent.
if she wants to play mind games with you, it is time to move on to the next potential love interest.
are you hearing yourself?
i suppose it depends. have you ever committed a felony?
yes, but i have not met the right person, which i would die for.
a girl should like who you are as a person.
so why shouldn't it be normal to do it on the phone?
you can say that, but do you really mean it?
i married a handsome, yet mean man, and i divorced hi.
obesity is the second highest killer in young people now.
so he says you do not truly love him, because you only called him two times?
be firm and tell him that it is over.
pity does not get you intercourse from me.
my boyfriend farts and belches loudly.
my friend told me that she loves me.
you should enjoy and live your life.
hang out with them.
do it if you love him.
maybe it can be just for the thrill of the experience.
our family hated that i was in an interracial relationship, my father and grandmother were livid.
before you do all of that, go to a flower shop and surprise her with a nice bouquet of flowers.
don't try that, you will put yourself in danger.
if you are on top, then you will have control of the situation.
i hope i was helpful.
no, i do not care about that of my boyfriend.
seducing a woman is a nice feeling. an achievement.
i do not focus on a man's posterior.
you do not. you merely proceed with your life and pretend to do so.
when someone hurts you, then you will have someone else to fall back on.
do not be afraid to tell him what you want.
men like a little mystery in a woman, but not too much.
there is less evidence of attraction between two people without sexual intercourse.
if it is during coitus, then she is not a virgin.
the problem is that i do not know if she is interested in me.
if he loves you, then he will care even about petty things.
first of all, the man did not do it to you.
and i cannot allow him to notice that.
do you still love him?
that is how my wife keeps my attention.
tell her that she needs to get a life.
what can i do with her for fun after school?
you can not ask silly questions like this.
i am not criticizing you at all!
don't text and ask, that is lazy.
my boyfriend loves me, and i hope your boyfriend loves you.
it would look interesting, but it is fine as long as you love each other.
maybe he doesn't want to have a conversation with you.
if it is against your religion, then i'm sorry, i am not sure what to say.
i don't know who you met.
don't make yourself sound so disgusting and cheap, married men are not available.
you just started a big mess, amusing.
some people require a little push.
both of you should be understanding and work to adjust accordingly.
if you want a decent man, i am available.
you don't need to worry, i agree with @_num_, there is something bothering you.
it means she is attracted to you.
nine out of ten times, what you want to see him wearing, he isn't comfortable wearing.
try to move on to another woman.
boys are emotional, but they don't show it because they feel it makes them look weak.
i need a partner that i can truly care for.
what are you saying, you seem to know nothing about women.
don't buy a woman clothing until she picks it out, you won't know what looks good on her.
love and trust her. she will love you more for doing so.
some people say that if they ask god for forgiveness for being homosexual, then they will enter heaven.
admit that she does not want to go on a date with you.
if your girlfriend loves you very much, then your past should not affect your relationship.
guys are physically stronger then women.
how do i tell him?
do not ask how you can get girls to like you.
there might be a reason for that behavior.
list as many as you would like.
if it takes a long time, then you should answer, "no," to that.
i have been married three times and have two sons.
who knows, in the end, it is all up to you.
if you really want to know, then just ask her.
there are more people out there.
if you liek him, you should go on a date with him.
did you ask him if he still finds you desireable?
i am good at problem solving, i learned it in school.
he does not seem like a kind person.
i like the first one, but i am fourteen years old. call me at _num_-_num_
it makes the phone feel slimy and gives it a strange scent.
your mother made you leave, therefore she no longer has the ability to influence you.
even if he never admits it, do not allow it if you do not want it.
it is frightening because you risk your emotions and give them to someone else.
the relationship can last forever if you work at it and grow with it.
it is pleasureable, and pleasant if you are married.
if you want to cry while talk to her, do so.
you want your cousin to love you?
please email me if you have the answer.
she would leave if she did not love you.
most girls will think that is weird if you wait too long.
enjoy you life, because you only live once.
has there ever been a woman that you've like a lot, but didn't want to date?
wwarnley's answer is a great example.
i did, we were together for two more years.
i think he didn't, because he felt bad about it.
be careful before it becomes a problem.
sometimes you have to show men what you're interested in.
i invested into the food business there.
i have romantic towards a girl i go to school with.
your first impression was uncomfortable, just stop texting her.
who is gwen stepani married to?
walking takes extra pounds off.
we have been talking approximately four to five months.
what are you waiting for? go after him.
when a girl looks at you, she is testing your interest.
i am a man. i know what you should do.
if it is a chess cake, then it is much better.
probably not, but again, i do not think i would want him to do so.
allow him to become inebriated, then remove your clothing.
in your opinion, what can a woman do, say, or look like in order to be sexually attractive?
some cannot live without it while others can.
go into the world and explore.
it is not a bad thing.
it must be something in the water.
his height does not matter. what is important is how in love the two of you are.
if you are a man, then act like a gentleman.
as for the love part, i do not know.
it was approximately ten years ago but they still love each other very much.
sometimes it is very unfortunate, but it will happen when it is meant to happen.
boys want to become men and men desire women.
of course that made me extremely angry.
just hug him at first and then look into his eyes and say i love you.
your rights are to go on a date and move on.
if you are twenty-five years old and he is thirty-four, that is not partiucarly bad.
nobody knows this woman's intentions. if she loves him, then she will wait.
it is not even for you.
we all go to his school.
try to observe how he acts.
just like other men, i too like women younger.
his wife may be less seductive now than she has been in the past.
make her realize that she is very important to you and that you are the man of her dreams.
try to smile before you look away, so that you do not make the girl think that she is unattractive.
i am smart, but i do not think that i am smart enough for him.
that only mean that you like yourself.
i hate to tell you, but it is going to get a lot worse once you are married.
but, if not, then he is not at all worth the trouble.
post an advertisement in the washington post.
why are the two of you married in the first place?
then they may pursue you or, otherwise, it was simply not meant to be.
you are just another booty call.
i enjoy watching a woman masturbate and will have sex with her as soon as she finishes.
i do not want to be a burden.
i would do it as it costs nothing.
why are men stronger, tougher, and more honest and hardworking?
i go out of my way to get a married man.
i see that she is terribly upset, what can we do?
i do not have a lot of money for fancy clothes, flowers, a lot of food, and all of the other wedding paraphernalia.
i speak many different ways, maybe i can help you.
what is so hard to understand? that man only wanted to get into your pants.
does everyone like themselves or at least their appearance?
not accusingly, but simply a nice conversation.
in my opinion, it is good to test it before committing to it.
he tried to love me romantically but he cannot.
want to come see my hard drive?
why would he go to jail?
let your family know that this person makes you happy.
wait because you are still a kid.
you should make the first move.
the woman of my dreams will be everything that i need.
it is okay to like him, even though others do not.
why do men lie?
tell them you do not want to have sex
it is better to "let us quit".
if you are ok with it, do not second guess it.
i will not do anything if the person does not love me back.
i wish i knew the answer.
play with his little friend while he is playing.
admittedly, we are simple creatures, however some men and women are just abnormal.
there is no way to know for sure.
yes, you can, but it may not be love. most likely it is a strong emotion.
i had a single date with a man who seemed very nice over the phone.
a twenty-three-year-old man who has never had intercourse with a woman.
tell her you have done that and contracted pubic lice.
do it for your country.
have them take a lie detector test.
please help me, this is a significant problem for me.
they are a large part of your life.
how about when he screams looking for his razor?
tell him what is making you doubt him.
it is fine, as long as you have romantic interest in him.
i still know a girl looking for her soulmate.
either way, it is going to be painful.
do not be foolish and ill-advised. you should strife for average in intelligence.
rent everything and have one of your family members take pictures or recordings.
trust me, later in life, you will regret it.
i think that _num_ to _num_ years old is a good age.
i am just anxious.
this of amount of fun he would have if he was dating a girl in junior high.
it may be hard, but act like you're not interested.
love isn't terrible, you should give it a chance.
do not just give this to her.
no, as long as both of you are adults.
if you ask her for her phone number and she does not give it to you, then she does not have feelings for you.
let this person know that you love them.
if he does not present you with a direct answer, or tries to disappear, then you know what you will need to do.
it all depends on how long you've been together.
if she ignores you, leave her.
if he only slightly likes her, then she shouldn't be upset.
you need a marriage counselor, or a larger bed.
go to various clubs and join groups to have fun; i wish you good luck.
spend a lot of time with your girlfriends having fun and being around other men.
did you make him talk or did he volunteer the information?
go out with your friends and have a great time!
but now i reallyy love my wife very much.
a great sense of humor, good-natured, and self confidence.
it is the holy grail.
is having sex with your boyfriend normal?
i have learned that if a man likes you he will show it.
i have been there and done that.
i have too many things to live for.
where should i go for help?
i suggest that you tell him that you need to respect your best friend and he should respect you.
you could take him to a good bar where you can play darts and shoot pool.
be happy that you are mature and attractive enough.
no contact at all. it is just a simple crush, or do i have to get over it.
that, or you could just flirt a little bit.
of course, because i would not be able to life with her death.
do not her her. good luck, just remember that there are a lot of men in the world.
that depends on your choice. i enjoy "dog style".
what happens if the relationship does not work out?
you two should be having a lot of intercourse.
females are too paranoid.
maybe your love wasn't that much when you got married, you just thought it was.
then you can do these things together.
give me your input because i hate valentine's day.
just be who you are and enjoy whatever it is you like.
no, only if you would like your friend to watch as well.
we have sexual interactions over the telephone every day and never tire of it.
not at all, though it can make it much worse.
treat him just like you would treat a good friend that you have not seen in a long time.
if you are really her friend you will not even consider it.
i am almost at the point where i do not even care.
no, but if you are in love with someone sex is a completely different experience.
people who are losers do not usually like other losers.
yes, i used to do it often.
that is a very good question. i can not think of a single thing.
if the two of you do not have intercourse, then there is no problem.
would you appreciate having your future husband be unfaithful?
haven't i seen you on a cd? i like meeting famous singers!
if he loves her, then why not be in a relationship with her?
why can't you just ask her out on a date?
you can get ideas off of the knot website.
my opinion is to break up with this man.
there should be no reason why you cannot go out with him.
beat him up and get rid of him.
do you want to marry a man in a trial for two attempted murders?
you will know her when your feelings change.
just shorten your story and i hope i can help you in many ways.
he did not really love you if all he wanted was a makeout session.
i know because my ex did the same thing to me.
the answer is, "yes," for the long-term, and, "no," for the short-term.
yes, but it depends on how long you have been unfaithful.
he should absolutely not marry her, at this time.
my girlfriend really likes anal sex.
do not be so possessive and give him some freedom because men like that.
no, as a male i enjoy it when a woman masturbates in front of me.
maybe you like the bad boys?
men do not like women to tell them what they should do.
do you want to come and sit in my cockpit?
i myself think it is rather strange.
she cannot stop you from being with your little man.
even when his phone is on silent mode, he can see the missed calls.
run quickly and never look back.
if she is shy, then she is most likely very interested in you.
and you can start any time, so long as you have protection.
continue until you obtain the next level (level four).
one was a wolf, the other a very large lab.
some men so and some men do not.
this sounds strange, but try watching both heterosexual and homosexual porn.
if he treats you, great. who cares what his butt is like?
i praise my god, and i forgot my wife.
tell him anytime, he will probably participate if he is interested.
i couldn't believe it, until i saw her eyes in person.
maybe she is being difficult, she is probably interested in you, but hasn't vocalized it yet.
would you like to discuss what is happening?
and why do the women there have facial hair?
objects can get lost but memories are harder to lose.
and consider asking your older sister again.
surprise her with it and give her small presents during dinner.
he knows that he does not know me very well.
yes, in my partners eyes.
if you can wait, it is worth it.
i used to be like that.
you will never get any peace if you keep him around.
forget about him. do not try too hard to make him think you no longer care about him.
i hope not. i have enough trouble with homosexual people looking at me in awe on earth.
it means she probably would not have left you if you had calmed down back then.
perhaps you married the wrong man.
yes, but i hope i never have to do so.
women want intimacy more, while men deny that intimacy.
you don't want to spend the rest of your life with regret.
you can go to a separate location with your boyfriend when the two of you are free.
sex feels great and is one of the most important things a man can do in life.
you might try to do or be that if you knew.
what should i do?
two words, "old maid", are for you if you are waiting for prince charming to come and find you.
keep your boyfriend, but find a lover!
loving a woman of low reputation.
how can i go and talk to her?
get rid of anything that has to do with him.
i am curious about what this is all about?
you know what you want, correct?
do not do it.
are you a guy or a girl?
most people do not get there.
are you and your spouce still together?
what can we do? put an ad in the paper?
just look around you, i believe this is hell and heaven.
tell him to leave her alone, he should be looking for another one.
if we want money you just want sex not love.
she is not even in college yet, and you want to have a serious relationship?
how cool, and we should thank him each day for wonderful feelings of sex!
okay, if you want it to be special for her, do not buy here edible panties!
your last recourse is to cling to jehovah god and pray to his son jesus christ!
do they really love you or do they just say it?
i do not think so unless you are trying to commit suicide.
i like a great kisser, but great sex is nice, too.
my friend has no idea how much that negatively impacted me.
how else would you be other than direct?
if he loved you to begin with then he would not have wanted you to have an abortion.
if you actually feel you are in love, you ought to board a plane and elope with them.
that very moment is when you need to relax for a time.
i have never been with a man that isn't in shape.
you have created a very tangled web.
please explain why you did not ask him out.
i would want my daughter to be a lesbian because i know how men treat women.
in that case, it will not be illegal because you will be holding her for ransom instead of dating her.
ask a question you might get an answer to instead of just points.
some people are just very ignorant.
ask her and she should honestly tell you.
according to me it is unfair!
if someone used sexual props and it was not good, then it did not help them.
say, "what if we got married one day?"
i suppose you are strange. be genuine. you cannot please a human.
what is your problem? you are already married.
you cannot train them to put the toilet seat down and you definitely cannot change their minds.
i have been in this situation.
i know this is a lot to remember, but trust me.
please help me. what should i do?
a woman married a dolphin, so why not?
things that make me no longer aroused are body odor, passing gas, and constant belching.
if you have back pain, get a breast reduction.
not all married men cheat, i did not when i was married, my wife was my life.
like peach fuzz is okay, but not hairy like a mens chest can get.
you are supposed to sign that thing?
my neighbor thinks that she is playing with you.
you have a long history with him and know his true self.
you could ask if she would like to go for a soda, (i am joking).
i do not get overly concerned about it.
he is an inspiration, so i want to be close, but i do not want to get involved.
that question is funny.
that is what a guy would want.
i have the same idea about wrestling.
they are weak minded, it is not your fault.
why did you enjoy doing it?
if they do, then ask him to spend time with you.
yes, the woman i love is worth death. if she died, then i would no longer want to be alive.
if you want to be someone capable of being in a relationship, then be genuine.
do you not know the importance of sex?
guys like it when a girl asks then out.
i do not want to do it, but i also want to.
how often? why or why not?
hou need to find someone younger.
you see her appearance and that is it.
you are a great person so just hang in there and keep your chin up.
and it is worth it when someone is as sexy as you are.
yes, of course, and the cake should have a poem written on it.
it is not a relationship if you can not talk to eachother.
not everything can be hairy.
you will feel it, and that is when you will know.
i would not doubt him.
men like to stare at our breasts.
is there something wrong?
give it some time, it has only been six months.
the best way is to tell them.
if you cannot tell, ask.
tell your parents you love them and then move on.
god does not care. love is love.
men want sincere and caring women who can accommodate them in life, nothing else.
they feel like they are not needed by their husbands.
always listen to your intuition.
open it and ask her just like you just did.
i am unsure of that.
think about what her favorite restaurant, coffee shop, vineyard, etc.
none of the above. ask me about men and boys, and i will tell you.
i do not want to be mean, but it sounds like he may have some issues with monogamy.
yes, i am not having a good day, either.
if you are under the age of _num_ you have a big problem.
maybe that is just how he is.
i love sex too and cannot get enough of it.
go out with him once and then continue if you enjoy that date.
ask her politely why you have not heard from her in years.
get divorced and then prove to other woman that she is unintelligent.
the position they like best is walking upright in the shopping mall with your money!
do what you have to do because it is not wrong.
you can have intercourse if you want.
she sees you more as a friend and nothing more.
it is the french that everyone was using that also works.
remember that dating does not have to mean being boyfriend and girlfriend..
everyone wants the perfect man, but nobody seems willing to be one.
treat her as if shse on one of your friends.
it was not meant to be.
women do not care about it like men do.
i am dating this girl. i have met her parents, and they like me.
if i knew, then i would be in front of you.
talk to him, stop wasting time.
if being apart makes them happy, then you should be happy for them.
what is a good present for a woman in whom i am interested who does not yet know it?
trust me, you will be asked on a date soon enough.
do not attempt something you'll regret later.
do not speak with him, he is not the man for you. he's giving you terrible advice.
i'm sorry that occurred. do not be bamboozled again. save yourself the pain.
in real life i do not think anything happened.
he is also doing that in the same house where he is living currently without angelina knowing.
it sounds suspect to me, and i think she has something to hide.
get yourself a beautiful outfit, cook his favor dinner and have intercourse with him.
sometimes you can't go home.
ensure that you are not being excessive.
the answer is oxygen. without oxygen you cannot live. that was a good question aurora.
have you ever been in a realtionship with a man that you were interested in, however, you were not really sure?
take the time to learn how to use chopsticks.
that depends on your gender.
somewhere inside yourself is strong. that will make him weak.
make her think that you do not even think about her at all.
if you are already having sex with the man, the best thing to do is continue.
i can lend you a few.
you start by kissing and then go a little further.
both of you need freedom in the relationship to bring closure and to move on.
you should tell her how you feel.
i would only be disappointed in it if the guy starring in it is not attractive!
why is she interested in being a spectator?
men always beat women to the punch when it comes to lying, women are no good at it.
many married couples have gotten married inside of a correctional facility.
as the saying goes, put yourself in their shoes.
they will always remain in the same fashion.
i recently acquired a labrador and i truly enjoy him.
dreams do not mean it is going to happen.
it was an eye-opening experience for me.
although it's not factual, and therefore should she be deceitful, it's merely concerning boys and being fond of her.
you're not genuinely required to request her romantic partnership.
she's fond of you as she would be of a sibling.
exclusively one, the initial and the concluding.
simply persist attempting to locate that unique person.
is this too far for you?
well, that is how i see it anyway.
they have got to be in the mood for love, and just let it all go!
but, do not let that bother you any.
what about the trust when things get a little tough?
have someone else tell him for you.
roses are red. violers are blue.
if you are intersted in him, say yes. if you are not, say no.
we have hormones too.
do you understand now?
we are both _num_ i have a small budget. he likes chocolates. is that bad?
if you do not know, i will not tell you.
he might have found another way to please himself.
if it is too ling, it hurts.
just be yourself. see what happens.
that is ridiculous. perhaps you merely have problems with asian women.
it means that she likes you as though you were her brother.
do you mean time or longitude?
no, but if you get pregnant, then your child could be stillborn or have birth defects.
emotions and feelings are what count.
do not give into him easily. it could give him too much control.
i love a man who is not afraid to show his sensitive side.
i have to read what you said, however, thank you for the ideas.
i married my high school sweetheart's sister.
it is best that your partner also be your bestfriend.
if you are worried about the lack of commitment, have a conversation about it first.
i do not let my girlfriend wait on me.
dream about me for four years then leave my boat.
do not have intercourse with him for a while to make him go crazy!
do not go on another date with her.
he either wants a break, thinks you are boring, or he is seeing someone else.
find someone who wants a future with you.
this wedding is simply not about you.
i hope this answer helps you.
i strongly want to get back with him.
do that and see if he still wants to remain in your life.
in this case, you are my husband and i am your girlfriend.
you might as well let the garbage pile up.
think about it as you do not want to mess up a good friendship.
women do not have to have a g-spot to find sex enjoyable.
is he trying to be a pimp?
i have learned many things on the internet that i did not know before.
you must protect yourself and go through whatever channels necessary to make yourself covered.
if you look out your window, you will see me.
of course you are number _num_ why would you ask me that question?
i am curious if any women have advise about having sex for the first time.
listen to your mind and heart.
maybe it is because you are older than you say. you gave me a negative answer, so here is yours.
invitations to talk online are dangerous, please be more realistic.
hey, then you have to ask!
something unique, and not ridiculously expensive?
you do not have to pay state and federal grants back.
i am in my mid-twenties, and am still a virgin.
i did not know until now, but hey! here is one for you!
men are good at it. we could not compare.
many men try to pretend with girls they are attracted to.
it means they love you and wants you back.
i would like only females to reply to my question, please.
i agree with being exclusive.
intercourse is simply intercourse.
only if she is twice your age.
you do not know what you are doing when asking a question such as that.
unless they genuinely desire it as much as you do.
if you feel as if he is, chances are that he is indeed.
there is enough of that type here.
i hear there are a lot of girls that go there.
you should get drenched in the rain, and have him carry you.
where does he see his life going?
try wallstreet, i mean stocks and all.
you never have to ask, look him in the eyes, see to his heart and soul and you will know.
touching is so important, it has no language barriers and carries so much warmth that it can lift a persons spirit.
jon asked me if i would be jealous if he went on a date with alyssa.
how can i get paid through the internet?
it hinders you from enjoying fun activities with others.
do not worry, you should grow out of that.
a better question is why is he your boyfriend?
it depends on the size of the male gentialia.
i want to try to make things more exciting.
yes, if i was trying to end the relationship.
be loyal, kind, amusing, and sweet.
your story is like a television series.
who can i answer if i do not know whether you are a boy or girl.
we control our own lives, and unfortunately we do not practice that enough because we look outward for answers.
try raising yourself because he is not obliged to feed you!
get to a doctor if you have not already.
he will be jealous, and then confront him about his own actions.
you can contact me at _num_@hotmail.com, then we can talk about this more later.
it is nice that you're interested in this girl.
please respond in french, so they know how many guests to expect.
what in the world does that mean?
do not go back for him.
it was all in my head.
i do not know how to get over him.
that only works in the movies.
who is more important to you?
are you not answering your own question?
and by all means, do not do it during your period, that is disgusting.
if he will not sit with you, then know it is just a friendship.
we have had plenty of ups and downs.
i feel like we have had so much time together that it would be a mistake to break up now.
how am i going to be able to handle not being a jealous girlfriend.
what goes on in men's heads?
i need your help with this, and i am guessing that you need a man's perspective on this right?
if you have to ask, then you already know the answer.
would you date a girl who was a stripper?
you will see it is better.
you send a video of yourself having sex and it pays.
why do you not just tell her the truth?
it is not a sin, and you can go as far as you want.
drop me an e-mail, and if you live close enough, then i will date you.
break up with him, since he is obviously not interested.
you can ask him out, and see how he responds.
i need some answers.
i had sex with my boyfriend.
you are my one and only true love.
my suggested response would be "no" unless the suggestion is coming from you best friend.
if you are not living in the miami area then i suggest you move here soon.
call her and express your love.
this man and i became quite close in the past few weeks.
are you perhaps sending an inappropiate message?
don't tell them that you are a virgin.
i love not having to worry for anyone except myself.
i don't like large breasts.
that is great, i still have a long way to go but thank you for the points!
that is one of the things love is all about, honesty.
when he knows i am not paying attention, he will stare at a woman.
i would probably break up with him.
women like a challenge, not someone she can walk all over.
they have never had anyone treat them that way, so they are apathetic.
we are better liars than men are.
don't you have men that you like but you do not date?
showing her should cause fewer fights than hiding things.
i see others the way i want to see them.
play with the men to get over him.
he is a jerk, but he says he wants to be with me.
break off relations with him. you're squandering your days by remaining in a relationship.
if a male/female is unable to be forthcoming, proceed to erase him/her from memory!
it shall simply exist as an enigma for everyone!
i guarantee i will avoid including my friends as partners!
she was aware of my presence and i have affection for her.
if you slowly approach her, her body language will let you know.
it does not mean he does not love you.
i am crushing on a man and i know he likes me, too.
yes, dark hair, dark eyes, and skin and they are rumored to have nice rear ends.
either he is busy or he is not good at making decisions.
spend time with him and see what he is like.
the waves in bora cay normally do not get that big even though it is raining.
you know that they are just dreams.
and i am always going to have to struggle to make ends meet.
take it slow and try to make it perfect.
their head is not on their shoulders.
i know that he is jim.
do you not love it, when a man does that?
it is so sweet to have a date on a cruise.
if you are aroused, you really like him, and you know that he is the one, then have intercourse.
if that does not work, then talk to a friend, but not about him.
do you have a photograph page or something similar?
honestly, i like men who have not been with many other women.
you are not a good person.
that simply means that they are not playing games with their sexuality.
different women have different times.
that depends on your relationship.
if you love other people, they will love you in return.
he already cheated on your cousin, so i think he will cheat on you another time.
trust me, i consider myself a relationship doctor.
i am crying because i still think about him often.
or pretend he is not there.
no, but who is happy, anyway?
it is easy to say yes, but i feel as though it will be tough to do.
you do not need to worry about that.
that cannot be the problem.
it does not mean he is flirting with others, but i would still be suspicious!
do not flaunt that it does not excite you, it will give the impression you are cocky.
i realize my parents are happy being apart.
how do i get it to come out again?
your male bond is strange.
he is not worth your time anyways!
if it does not mean anything then why is she dating another girl.
please do not do this. you deserve a lot more.
asian women are old.
let her know that it bothers you and if she does not stop then leave her.
i will say wait until she is ready to wear a bra.
i prefer a friend to whom i can talk to!
make him think you have interest in his best friend.
send your ex a nice valentines day gift.
it isn't over until the fat lady sings.
click on my avatar and find my questions and they are almost identical
do not say that because most men are not stupid.
you are making me feel like i just took tow benadryl tablets.
does it matter if you are shy?
and if we broke up because of it, i would deserve it.
doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
most bad kissers are bad because they don't even know they are.
heck no, move on. been there done that.
if you don't doubt him anymore, your instincts are always the best sign.
dark hair, dark eyes and olive skin.
if he is attractive and i really liked him, then i would. that is my opinion, and it is up to you to decide.
i only care about who she currently is.
if you ask me, and you did ask me, it is too risky.
perhaps when the ache of love consumes you.
just message me, and we will talk about this.
i guarantee there is someone who is interested in her who she is missing because she cannot forget this other man.
i am not sure but if you find mine, tell me, because i want it back.
they no longer want to be your friend, correct?
no, it is not a good idea until you get a partner.
did you ask him what caused him to be unfaithful?
that is just too much skin showing for my taste!
wait a minute, even now, all of their stuff is fake.
then, you distract her and get out of there!
invite him over for a home cooked meal, or maybe a movie!
love them because god loved you first.
so you can learn from it.
the same reason most women are stupid.
learn how to spell, i can't understand your question.
you will find someone better, someone you deserve.
i am not sure, but be careful.
it is not only about how long it is, it is about how long and thick it is.
try a card, if you cannot say, "i love you."
find out what he would like to see you wear, then go back, and buy it.
do not force it because you might make a mistake if you do.
why would she miss someone that was never hers in the first place.
my breasts are too big.
i see it online, everywhere. i was simply wondering.
it is not attractive, if you ask me.
you need to talk this out before you make a bigger mistake.
you need to confront her and tell her that you are the man of her dreams.
how old are you? i would like to be your friend.
yes, get out of there quickly.
they think differently than you.
you should move on with your life and find someone new.
i believe you have a boyfriend.
the one i had with your mother.
do any other girls feel the same way?
how many minutes into the first date?
i like him, but i do not know if he likes me.
sometimes it does not matter if you know how to use it.
what kind of friend are you searching for?
how much do balls sweat?
lately he avoids me, and will not talk to me.
do a provocative dance for him.
i enjoy women who have agreeable personalities.
i enjoy school teachers, although i am not one.
however he sometimes still acts as if he does.
it would depend on how far that you would let me go.
he is obviously going after another girl so i would stay away from him.
you have a happy valentine's day.
i am always happy when i wake up in the morning. i am at work, now.
have i told you lately that you are adorable?
keep your head high and do not give up. keep hope that things will work out.
there are some good country boys out there that would love to date a good country girl.
ask her out on a casual date.
do not encourage your girlfriend to be a stripper.
because that description surely screams "flirting".
yeah, my boyfriend is crazy about my toes.
if you love someone then you sacrifice being with other people.
i wish you the best, and have a wonderful day!
i had intercourse with a man who was very robotic in his movements.
does he still have feelings for me, or is he playing games?
you should love someone for their personality, not the color of their skin.
there isn't such a thing as fake love, true love is just a euphemism.
if you only want to be with your former partner, then leave the others alone.
there is not need to keep playing games.
it may be possible that because of your appearance, he has no choice but to look at you.
i recommend that you simply talk to her and ask her to go out to dinner, for example.
if she is attracted to you, that would be great.
come on over here, it is okay now.
just try saying, "hey, let's get together some time."
first of all, they are just like you. so you should not call them daft and unattractive.
maybe he believes that it is your fault that you are a parent.
i do not think you can tell that soon.
there must be a reason why she is getting jealous.
he needs to have some firsthand experience.
find me if you would like to have a lot of fun.
incorrect, however your beauty appears greater to him after sundown due to your father being asleep, lol.
i'd wager you're a great-looking individual and have no reason to be envious of it. enjoy the world and have a good time!
don't permit these young females to be deceitful with you!
a query which resulted in your hysterical reaction.
you are a sad case.
you can tell him why if he asks.
what if they were men?
it is not going to last, go have fun.
do not ask him. annoy him until he asks you on a date.
perhaps because you are different than everyone else.
the best way is to look straight into his eyes and you will get the answer.
besides, do we truly want our mothers to be liars?
tell him in his love language (we each have ours); find out his love language, and speak it.
do you truly want to spend the remainder of your life with someone like that?
every time i talk about it, he says that i am pushing him
i would probably think that he is having relations with someone else.
sometimes i go across country to go back to my hometown, where he is.
remember that this man needs to help pay for your expenses, also.
if you just laugh out loud, then you will feel better.
what did you expect?
it sounds like he enjoys being around you.
why, does skin color matter?
go to the wedding.
i like meeting new friends.
just because a black man breaks into my house, it is not fair to say that all black people are criminals!
do not be a wimp.
however, i like the woman to be loud.
stay if he has money and is not creepy.
write a note if it is about cheating.
if you ask him upfront, i don't believe he would lie to you.
have a good life without him.
the man you are speaking of is not a good man, very controlling.
the next day i went with my boyfriend to dinner.
there are no young men in this town who i would want to date.
i want her to want me.
you should not think that, because then everyone will think you are unintelligent (like me).
was his boss mean to him?
she just has this constant fear.
beautiful girls can be found everywhere.
distance makes it harder to lie.
i expect he will go to jail even if you say it was mutual.
all those commercials that say condoms don't always protect aren't entirely true.
if is different from week to week then i doubt it, check for the signs, eye contact, flirting, etc.
should i discontinue our relationshp or continue it in the hope she indeed loves me?
never go to the places that you once frequented.
should i return or stay home?
do not, however, feel bad or hurt if he disrespects you, and remember that life is long.
yes you love him, but do you want to risk that he gets something that he brings back to you?
most men are not truly unintelligent; you are simply meeting the wrong people.
i believe it is a myth that men are simply interested in intercourse.
even though it is acceptable, your partner does not need to know everything you think about.
was it a good dream?
if he is only interested in friendship, it is best to move on.
what comes around goes around.
it depends on the man.
to make him happy, buy him a flower and say you love him.
leave her. life is way too short!
you know we do it as well!
the boy is _num_ to _num_ years old and he likes me.
if you decide to go for it then have fun!
there is not much that you can do if a guy does not want to be in a relationship.
do things that make you happy.
it depends on the girl, i suppose. i lie all the times and people really buy it.
the best town is in your imagination, because if that is all you want you will never get anything.
it is not good to date them all.
have you heard of a pajama party?
men do like it when women can spell, or are not too lazy to look words up.
do not answer if you do not know what you are talking about, because it could be some creep.
i have been there and it is a beautiful place.
as for the man, just try to ignore him and eventually it will be forgotten.
to answer your question, there is no way to understand men.
i just want to meet friends in amsterdam.
she behaves as if it's not something she does, as a result, what's my course of action? court her or allow her to remain unaccompanied?
you attempt to maneuver its direction at a measured pace. no man enjoys learning of his own sub-par kissing skill.
it's similar in nature to inquiring whether love was ever manifest. not all individuals are ill-intentioned.
do you have a certain type of schizophrenia?
what questions do you enjoy being proposed?
do something crazy like cover yourselves in whipped cream or something else delicious.
do not just wait for something good to happen.
if he is very cute, what do you do then?
threaten him by saying you are going to call the police if he does not pay child support.
at the time, they might laugh, but it does not mean anything.
i am not positive on what my decision should be.
for this man to express himself in this way reveals what kind of person he is.
if your reason is because you have affections for some one else, then communicate that.
there are unwise, and rude, and they will have to learn their lesson the hard way.
it makes it easier to access.
he has way too many girlfriends, i find it confusing.
not being a virgin is a sin in the eyes of the lord.
stop trying to control her life.
why would a man want to date a frigid ice princess like you?
i am just trying to avoid any arguments, she is very jealous!
some men are afraid of getting married or making a commitment, so a good talk might help!
this question is for the men, would you want to date a virgin or not?
boys are simply boys, and think their head hurts when in actuality they have no brains.
why do many men dream about living with asian women?
i believe it depends on whether you want an emotional attachment.
you should close your eyes and do what pleases you.
once an adulterer, always an adulterer.
talk to me. you cannot be that lonely!
anger is your way of saying "you can no longer hurt me!"
to be completely honest, that is so sexually stimulating in itself!
date someone, who is more in-tune with your maturity level.
i wouldn't be attracted to that woman.
it is healthy, and natural, but be careful and wear protection.
take some time to reflect on yourself.
he got what he wanted from you.
most men are in constant need of intercourse.
i would question how much of a friend, your best friend is.
if you are considering taking him back, do not.
you should send him a message from your cell phone.
god moves in many ways.
when you are at least _num_
he loves you for being his one and only.
i had the same problem and look at the answers i received.
it is your time and your life!
he will understand and not think anything about it.
i hope that helps you, even a little bit.
the leading cause of divorce is getting married.
if he is not willing to lick it, do not let him stick it.
i hope you have some intimacy soon.
i did that, and i did not like it.
you cannot force yourself on anyone or you will have no one.
if you are not growing and having fun, the relationship is dead.
i also have that problem but if you are nice in bed, she will not even notice.
get her things that are meaningful.
it depends upon your age.
having younger friends, helps to make you think and feel younger.
back away woman, i dislike you vehemently.
i do not think that the husband deserved to have it.
you get in life what you pay for.
yeah, its possible. it happens to me a lot.
i am a woman and only think about sex if i am in love with a man.
if he is cheating then kick him out.
think about the std's he may bring home to you.
there is no way that women will understand men.
party while you are young.
i heard your getting married, when is it?
try some honesty, it works for me.
if he asks you out it's up to him, you blew it.
i absolutely love italian women.
i'm till trying to figure that one out myself.
not having sexual relations is very beneficial when the woman is grotesque.
why are the most exciting sports, the ones with a lot of contact.
once you move on, then you will not mind whether he moves on or not.
first of all, that is not typical of a man.
most women talk about it for sure. they even have novelty parties with intimacy toys.
it didn't end too well.
think about what you'll say before hand, so you don't stumble on your words.
participate when you are married.
if she does it again, then it is your fault.
this all started _num_ months ago with flirting.
go out with your old friends in order to meet new friends.
while you are out and about he will accidently run into you.
get her flowers and chocolate if she is romantic.
i do not like the "bad boy" type.
silly songs are in the right direction!
try to hook him up with a friend.
i married someone i met at a strip club.
i want it more than guys do.
they actually have younger brains than we do.
i met him though a friend.
you should think it through.
i am not one of them.
hello. how are you? what is your name? i would like to meet a friend in amsterdam.
i am not a prude. i enjoy sexual things.
guys do not understand girls, and vice versa.
he is not your friend if he has had sex with your girlfriend.
i am not a good liar.
she could have said no.
i constantly think about coitus, even more than my male friends.
it feels unpleasant. alright, goodbye.
it is sad, the way some people behave.
listen to the song "baby baby stay gone" by jimmy wayne.
i do not even talk to other guys.
if that advice does not work, i do not know what to tell you because it sometimes works for me.
if she is already involved with someone, you have to set your sites on someone else.
it is very simple as long as you back up everything that you say to her.
in the event its size makes occupying the mouth impossible.
inquire as to whether he feels affection for your progeny. if not so inclined, end the relationship since relatives occupy first position.
one is made aware by the manner in which they view you and the manner employed by that individual to converse with you.
i've attended a small amount in the past.
less than every single female, however, certain females behave in such a manner.
i would stop calling, and see if he misses you.
your future doesn't look bright, it will lead to your demise.
what are the indications of a man who is flirting.
why would kill that innocent child?
i am in the dark as well.
mine is large in size.
bill gates probably never dated, and was considered ugly, and now look at him.
it is very telling that he doesn't like children.
best friends always come before romantic relationships.
a young woman who loves him and cares about him.
do not abscond, as he is only speaking.
keep that in mind, you may find out he is a really cool guy and wants to remain friends.
if this guy says no, then , he will not help.
do not let the rumors people spread get to you.
if you find out how let me know, and good luck!
no i am not soft on discipline, i am just trying to be fair.
dude, i hate to say it but she was cheating on you with this guy before you broke up.
i invited her over and we went inside my room and i shut the door.
there's this really hot guy in my neighborhood.
i am a gemini but honestly speaking, i don't believe in horoscopes.
it is the only thing that very serious women are very serious about.
instead of a girl who should find a guy that you are attracted to.
i enjoy embracing and kissing.
i don't really think too much about it.
don't say too much!
hold you head up and just smile.
do not look back.
would you say it is acceptable for me to have sex with my girlfriend?
commonly, every child has a father.
for a fun night, i would go to a club.
is that your answer? indeed they say that they will not cheat.
would you have sex with more than one man at the same time?
in my personal opinion, that is not useful.
what should you do if you are interested in a lady but you aren't sure if the feeling is mutual?
what should you do when your boyfriend doesn't text or call you for three weeks?
if you must ask, then you are most likely too young or too immature to get married.
yes, because most men behave that way.
it is your decision to make, but do not look too hard.
it is not good, as far as dating goes.
my male friends say that confidence, but not arrogance, is attractive.
well, perhaps you can phone her? or work really hard to earn some money to buy a car?
have sexual relations with his brother or best friend.
alternatively, you could spread rumors about her wherever you go.
maybe do not send an instant message requesting one's age, sex, and location?
i am telling you this from personal experience.
women do talk about it.
she did it once.
it can help your relationship.
let things fall where they will.
i saw them last year, and they were very good.
are you certain that you want to be with someone who doesn't know what he wants?
you should let her try wearing a sports bra.
you should tell her that you love her and then try to find the money.
you should admit that it was on your mind.
i don't know you well enough to love you.
stop having intercourse with him, which you should not be doing in the first place.
you become disinterested easily when you are with him or her.
you know whether you can trust your man; if so, do not worry.
you know what you should do.
ask him about it; if he denies it, and you know he is being unfaithful, leave him.
if she made you happy you would be glad to not flirt.
do not do anything for valentines day even if it sounds good.
homosexual men love listening to them.
it was at least one a week if he did call.
most men are not unintelligent, but you associate with the unintelligent ones.
i would say it is unacceptable; simply because he is a man does not mean that it is correct.
my wife said it simply depends on her mood at the time.
if you are truly looking for advice, do not do it.
first, do not do anything which you do not want to do.
is it because he does not trust me?
you're not very mature. you're best off speaking with your mother regarding that subject.
apologies, it's will remain forever uncomfortable and somewhat oddball-ish.
i simply desire a selection of quality romance tunes to enjoy. i'm aware of the sappiness quotient, however, so what?
divorce is not an action popular with children.
inform her that you've been wishing to share with her some information.
i cannot believe he is telling you.
i believe being in a relationship is the best!
this is the first time i have ever had to do something like this for anyone. please help!
allow it to remain that way, no matter how angry she becomes.
that is a foolish question to ask. if you do not know, then you never will.
i do not live there so i could not say. i am sorry.
ask her why she is in the relationship and how she feels about you.
i like it from behind.
they like to be on top, or from behind.
what feels right to you?
do not let another girl date your crush.
love comes first, and sex is better after marriage.
if i can not stop thinking about a guy that i like, i focus on work or read a book.
we girls will never know the answer to that question.
that is not nice if you do that to your friend.
just tell him that you like his friend and not him.
i hope you find new friends.
if you have to ask, the answer is that it probably is.
do you want to get married?
sex can be compared to air and water.
do not provide him with too many chance.
if you like her, i believe it may be acceptable.
he loves me more, because i was a virgin on our wedding night.
i don't agree that woman should approach first.
it depends on whether you're a girl as well, or not.
being a guy, i know that most guys are in relationships for their own personal gain.
did this person have sexual relations with their spouse, before they got married?
is that a question for a man?
try looking somewhere besides the losers section.
give him a chance, as well as some time, to get to know the children.
it depends on how old you are and how old your mom is.
if you are even asking this question, i think you may be too young to get married.
wait and see what she says.
ease into it, do not just jump on him.
the title of the movie is "he's just not into you".
i will tell you one thing: if you cheated on her, goddess help your soul!
you have to have confidemce enought to f
do not have sex with him, and see what he does then, great advice, i know!
i like him alot.
what do you feel about it?
having fun is most important.
that does not mean it is over.
he would not want me to do that.
they needn't be christian to cheat - women do it as well.
i'm sure they feel the same way about women.
to show someone's speech or actions in their own manner.
if he did, he would not cheat.
we never got together, though, because he regarded me as his best friend.
as long as he truly does not know the women, it will not matter.
you should be very respectful about it as well.
he is between _num_ and _num_, and how old are you?
i cannot believe i wasted years of my life with someone like you.
what should i try to change things up?
it takes time to develop.
tell him about the phone call.
you've admitted he is in love with someone else.
i would still have intercourse even with she had just been intimate with someone else.
my friends don't like him, and make fun of him often.
let your personality shine, don't try to be impressive, women can sense those that.
that is funny you've asked because i felt the same about a girl once.
you should become accustomed to men devaluing you as a person.
it is fate which does that.
my mother's friend willy lives there. find people on myspace, since there are many people from many places.
you can find a guy that you do not know, and have sex or get married.
poropse to her over a picnic lunch with a beautiful, quiet, privare setting.
you do not want to end up in that hostel.
if that is something that you enjoy, there is nothign wrong with that.
when you want to embrace him each time you see him.
everything reminds me of him and of what used to be.
it is so natural, why make an issue out of it?
i recently broke up with my girlfriend, but it is more difficult to get another one. can you please help?
did he do it on purpose?
i was thinking about how to kiss her next time.
however, i truly love this girl.
as long as she is not their boss.
being uncircumcised is unsanitary.
from my experience, it depends on both of you.
if she will not remain faithful to you, she is not worth it.
i am _num_ years old, and my height is _num_".
have a fun honeymoon!
my boyfriend notices a lot of girls when he is driving, and tries to not make it obvious.
money can byt material things, but it can not buy class, style, and grace.
karma is real, so, do not try to get revenge, she will get hers eventually.
and just so that you know, if the guys knew you had said that, no one would like you.
life consists of everyone hurting each other.
when i lost my virginity at _num_, i do not think i was missing anything special.
just ask him first if he would like to receive rated r photos.
no, but you should take care of it before you attempt to get pregnant.
if he says it is nothing, tell him you are not stupid.
did you not say for better or worse?
anytime he says, "come here.", go behind him.
to my best friend, from your friend for life. i like cereal.
an infant cannot decide whether it wants to live or die.
it makes me feel good about myself when other men court me.
one said, "i cannot leave my children." the other asked, "why do you want to have coffee with me?"
where is he working and how many hours a week? ask him.
there is no rush if you are only _num_
some guys do not like their behind being played with.
women enjoy being a mystery.
i think he trusts you.
i like a guy who used to be in my class.
i would like to get some advice.
the ego is very conflicting.
let them know you love them, and see if they tell you the same thing.
it is who we are, and there is nothing you can do.
our neighbors complain because i am loud.
well, one day i sat him down and told him that i like him.
you should be direct and say something like, "hey, are you going to let me join your conversation?"
he will definitely understand it at some point.
if he likes you, there's no reason you should not date him.
select me, but remember the importance and relevance of age - be specific!
no one can control what they dream of.
have you seen the paris hilton video yet?
men do not know what is best for a woman.
go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it.
it is every man's dream when she says it does not mean anything.
hang out with his friends to take your mind off of him.
i cannot answer becuase i have not experienced it, but it is possible.
i believe she simply wishes to come to america like all others, however that is just my opinion. take care.
he most likely thinks it is a good thing.
admiration is not reason enough to kiss.
crying is acceptable, however verbal communication is more productive.
pregnant women lose interest in that way.
speak with the man in question and learn what made him act in such an inconsiderate fashion.
i would probably not date an adult entertainer.
you no longer want to see his or her face.
he did not care if he knew.
some men were following me into a store and then said they never liked levi's jeans until now, and i ran.
they were once best friends, but now they are not.
i want to be myself, but i am scared i will drive her away. what should i do?
it sounds as though you care more about virginity than most guys.
tell him without having intercourse with him and you will not go over tainted.
she never stopped caring about you the first time.
why did you marry him knowing he is not talkative and you know you want him to talk to you?
do not take life seriosuly, you are young.
you need ot get a job.
if you are over _num_ years old, people treat you like you are _num_
i do not want to hurt anyone.
he just wants to talk to you.
your three year old has a daddy already.
i really want my ex-boyfriend to realize that i only want him.
if you find some barry white music, it works.
you may find a tall beautiful blonde but she will not be smart.
when i look back on it, i am not too sure why i did that in the first place!
maybe it is because you sound remorseful.
a good way to start is just to be honest and ask him to see how he feels and where his head is, don't you think?
i think i have ruined jon's friendship with matt.
it is probably was not the brightest thing for him to tell you that, but do not let that worry you at all.
i like a man named jon and he used to like me too.
and to top it off, i did not have an orgasm because the whole mood was lost with that headboard issue.
i would give you a hundred points for that one!
they have a lot of good suggestions there.
start talking about children around your parents.
no i did not, i waited until the man asked me out on a date.
i found out that my girl friend was really a male.
she knows that it is time for her to move on, but she can not, do you have any suggestions that might help her?
you just answered your own inquiry.
it is because they think they believe they are popular. they are when it comes to dating.
for the majority of it, it is quiet unless it is good, then i get loud.
some people are snugglers, some people are not.
do not be blind like i have been.
i am not the one who did anything wrong. i love him, what should i do?
i say this because it is true; it is not the only thing.
jon and i used to be extremely close and talk all the time about everything.
or does he tell you he does not want to do it right now?
that is when i started drinking and smoking.
why would you waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that way?
if girls do not like you for that, then they have the problem.
why can he not get a girl to share with him?
my advice is to not go out with strangers.
be honest with him and yourself, do you honestly want him back?
if you go to iraq, keep in touch.
at times, i think about only sex.
when a woman likes you, you should be able to tell.
they simply want to be loved.
a compromise position would be to refuse to spend time with her when she has been drinking.
and yet he tells me that they don't hold special meaning for him
you should move on and go have some fun.
i believe that you have lustful feelings for him.
also, let him know you had a bad experience with another guy thqt had tried something that put youmin a bad p
no, seriously, do not get him another dog!
for me, a girl that is mature.
did he not find me attractive that night?
he does not love you, do not listen to his excuses and break-up with him.
i would work some more with him.
honestly, many people put on false faces.
there's nothing you can do to stop it - it's simply a reflex, something we are prone to.
personally, i dislike artificial breast augmentation.
there will always be ups and downs in your life, and that is a fact you must accept.
you must take a stand.
the one you think is your boyfriend is not a real boyfriend.
i ended up liking someone after they asked me out, so just ask.
can i get custody even though he has been a stay at home father?
men perfer a lady in public, and a promiscuous woman in bed.
give him a fellatio once in a while.
i suggest you both have a hot bath!
introduce yourself and be nice to her.
are you able to handle a serious relationship?
when women get together gossip occurs.
odds are you would not get married anyway so find someone new!
that is because we make them nervous and their brains go out the window!
that is because they usually just like to make you feel bad.
i think they are more romantic.
you are too young and too many things can go wrong.
there is a reason why this happened. be patient. every piece of sorrow has a good part as well.
remember: just because a man knows you are with someone else, he may still try.
i would not lose even five seconds on a woman that is very attractive yet still unintelligent.
yes, it is beneficial to refrain from having intercourse.
most times, a guy is not too tired for sex.
as you are older, try doing things that you like doing.
go to the library or walmart to meet attractive women.
flirt with him and continue to get to know him.
do not let him see you down in the dumps.
yes, for your information, if that is a male friends then he already likes you.
honey, you can trust me because i am a guy
tell him that you don't want to marry him and if he keeps it up, you can leave him.
do you prefer circumcised or foreskin? why so?
so the next day, i emailed one of them and she said that she didn't want to be my friend.
how do i get out of it?
no, that makes you the girl of my dreams.
we get to know each other better.
believe that you will find your true love someday, just have faith.
once he cheats, he will always cheat again.
we find women of all shapes and sizes attractive, every man is different.
of course, just tell him everything you know.
instant message him pretending to be a girl looking for a nsa kind of relationship.
and he had thought i had enjoyed myself.

it sounds like a breakup to me.
my boyfriend, who i have been dating for just over a year, has lied to me continuously throughout our entire relationship.
it is the same reason as mine.

i begin quietly then gradually crescendo until i suddenly blast it loudly.
i cannot help thinking, "was it me?"
not all men are solely interested in intercourse.
he most likely enjoys intercourse for recreation.
if you like a man, speak with him and become acquainted with him.

would a handmade personalized gift suffice?
she will need to listen and find out what happens.
they are not the type of guy you are seeking.
has that happened to you before?
you do not even know his age?
forgive and forget as little as possible.
older as in three to five years, so he is very mature.

movies are fun but, it does not provide much bonding time.

if you like him, tell him. it worked for me.
yes, if you are a boy.
i am scared to ask if he likes me, because i like him too.

we sat on my bed, i looked her in the eyes, hugged her, and kissed her.
why do you want to get married?
you must accept the sorrowful truth.
do you not love your former girlfriend at all?
so you either cease to care about him, or wait.

however, an excess of positive circumstances may transform into a hindrance.
due to them possessing singularly defined thinking.
he's not fond of your children, you're not fond of his?
experience personalized entertainment at this point given your unattached status.

do not allow anybody to tell you different.
if the man is going to marry the woman, she must have not had intercourse with too many other men.
i am an old-fashioned man.
if you are with a sinner, you are a sinner as well.
no physical, eye, or hand contact. just faith in what the other says is the truth.

good looks, habits, and of course a great figure makes a girl a good girlfriend.
can you get a job and send him money?
you can give her a nice gift, and ask her then.
she will think that you are hiding something.
do not think about looks, look at how they treat you.
can anyone here speak fluent english?
it is about the person you're with.
who could say, "no," to tjhat?

i have two, so you can judge for yourself.
she asked me about my feelings.
my old man does not, he just digs right in.
he started flirting with me one day.
only if you feel like you need a boyfriend.
the same thing happened to me last night, nut it might be different this time.
would it bother you if you were asking guys for pictures?
it is good to experience new things, which you are doing.
if it does not work out, then it was not meant to be.
if he only likes you for what you do, try doing something that he would not like doing and see how he reacts.
talking about starting a family may spook him.
flowers, but not roses because that might be too much.
you do not need to proceed quickly, but you may want to tell him to slow down.
when i first became involved with matt, i was very interested in jon and i did not know he felt the same.
i would hide their lunch box and not play with them during recess.

it also makes people more anxious and jealous, so that is something to be aware of .
i have had this same problem many times; stay with both of them but be careful what you do.
it may be to far in your term to attempt an abortion.
a lot of men i know dream about this.
if he treated her appropriately then i see nothing wrong, she isn't even related to you.
men love themselves, it is unfortunate.
if she likes you, she will accept that you're a beginner.
it depends upon you. would you want to?
it bothers me because i want to be with him, but i also want to wait.
if you like another man, you should likely say that.
is the problem that you do not have one or that you are having difficulties with the one you have?
and he is not addicted to drugs or anything similar.
be friendly, not direct, etc.
he probably did not answer your calls because he was busy.
ask them when they got together on a lie detector.

i would be straight forward with your friend.
you can do better.
tell him your baby needs him.
i am twenty and also feel old.
do not blow it on a thing called "sex".
i wish they would treat us with respect.
if they are still talking, he may be cheating on you.
karma will rear its head on him again.
for the most part, yes.
women are not just ready, you have to help get them there.
do not ask him about it. let him say it on his own.
if i had to choose, i would choose african american, because caucasian men just do not attract me.
if you have already found another, then free him from your life so he can find another girl.
well, how do i tell him that i am now pregnant with his child, without him going ballistic?
do not prolong it, but instead make it brief and concise.
would you enjoy being called unintelligent?
i do not know, because my fiancee and i are like that as well.
my male paramour does as he states that it allows him an opportunity to inform me of how beautiful i am.
i also am partial towards children, but i am not one.
it is not only a male issue.
well, i would not necessarily simply ignore my friend merely because we squabble.
do you see yourself happy for the entirety of your life with this individual?
remember why the two of you broke up, then move on with your life as well.
head where your instincts lead you, even if it is in the wrong direction.
i need advice from other people.
break up with the one you have. believe me, she will be surprised.
in that case, a personality that is not too undesirable.
girls are not bad liars.
some people get pleasure form it, but it creeps me out.
it is normal to take some time to think.
you need to ask yourself if you like him!
that does not sound like a good friend, but that is my opinion.
if you are interested in both men and women, you are considered bisexual.
he should be compassionate enough to not play with others romantic feelings.
first, choose only one man you love.
but men are also people, and they have feelings just like women do.
i cannot think of any reasons.
i would not want my boyfriend to have lunch with another woman on valentine's day.
there are many reasons for divorce, such as money, children, infidelity, stress, and family.
for an older child, try mini golf, laser tag, go-karts, etc.
i was in love with my boyfriend of _num_ years.
i am really mature for my age as well.
when you find your diamond in the ruff, hopefully he will want you for you.
she is the boss, and you had an intimate relationship with her, and that is that.
how can i say no and continue to remain friends?
you will always wonder if you never tell him the truth.
i am a man, and you should take it slow and steady.
tell them right away not when a lot of people are around.
good things come to those who wait.
show her she is more important than your unintelligent friends.
first of all, no, it is not always about the appearance of a woman.
but he is as ignorant as i am.
i have always been nice to her every day. what should i do?
what kind of father does that make him?
i did not tell you to listen to my advice; so, if she breaks your heart, then it is your fault.
i loved him at once, but not after he humiliated me in front of forty people.
you both may need time apart.
that is just him saying he wants to have sex with you.
are you excited about being in love?
if he wants to be friends, so be it.
have you ever wondered why they must fight?
it is because that is all they ever think about.
we are not mind readers you know.
sometimes men say those things to lead you on.
could it be because you are single and could not get a date?
if you get mixed up in something messy, you'll end up messy as well.
oh, and this is important for ladies - have you ever tried the sample cosmetics at the mall?
just kiss him out of the blue one day.
that depends on whether he prefer war games, sports games, et cetera.
all men do it, even those who're married.
i think its okay to dream about different men.
you will never catch a woman admitting to it.
you love your wife if you are asking this question.
it will be hard if he doesn't notice you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
there will be no trouble if you brush your mouth twice.
some guys can not think around an attractive woman.
you are too young if you are _num_
you have to know her emotions and talk about them.
the money might be nice, but there is more going on behind the scenes.
it just depends on how it is.
you will not meet anyone unless you have a big penis.
i tried talking to him but he will not return my calls.
tell them how sad you are.
i live in romania, so come there with me!
you will wake up one day and just know.
they are happy so it could work for you as well.
believe me, you don't need to be involved with your friend's younger sister.
if you want to be with him, then stay with him.
if you are female, contact me on shrunkenmann_the grass@yahoo.com.
she really admires you and probably only thinks of you as a friend.
i would not worry here about being embarrassed.
oh, yes, send him one too if you reall feel the need.
you have some work to do there.
have a serious talk with her and tell her it is childish and you are no longer a child.
it is communication, but you have to be sure you want to do that.
now if you cannot say this to his face, scream it into the mirror when he is not around and i will tell you why.
as for what to do, do not do anything.
only if they are sick.
you will show him how.
i am looking for a virgin.
yeah, your mom is going out with him.
he will love you so much more.
if you think that this could lead you to heartbreak, wait and watch what happens.
he must have been a friend at one time.
the phrase to use is, "hey, i have enough friends".
most importantly, she is not a very good best friend, you need to be wary of her.
try yahoo personals to see if you like some guy.
tell him if he's interested you could go out sometimes.
start at the for a bit.
maybe my mother, but that's another story.
you might be too hot for your own good.
gon a a cruise and push her overboard.
do not push her for an answer or tell her that you love her.
however, that is not a bad thing if you are with someone responsible and you enjoy it.
thaat is because they do not use their head to think straight.
believe in yourself because that is very sexy!
i have dated several bisexual females and it is a huge turn on!
i suppose if i really give it some thought, i want to be with them both.
no, he just really enjoying switching girlfriends from time to time.
both, but if i need to choose just one i will say "beauty for this moment".
in my opinion, if your instinct tells you that there is something going on, then there is.
it is a little of both.
make love with someone you love.
have your best friend tell him.
that is what men do.
however, each time i return, the same difficulties arise again.
simply try to let him know you.
you do not know what actual problems are until you are married and have children.
that is a lie; if you truly love someone, your relationship will stay strong no matter what.
we frequently meet and have similar feelings.
perhaps he simply is checking to see how you are doing.
with love, it will be full of meaning.
please feel free to initiate a chat with me at any time.
you are still going to feel that you are unable to trust men.
you can't expect to give him anything to expensive.
believe what you would like to believe.
i would date a girl who had been a stripper, since it doesn't matter to me who she was in the past.
a sense of humor is very important.
he says that he respects and understand my desire to wait.
i thought that this boy was attracted to me; he would stare at me all throughout the day.
however if you feel amenable to it then it should be acceptable.
simply assure her that her parents lover her very much even though they no longer live together.
you will turn out to be a good sister.
it would seem people want what they cannot have.
you can be interested in whoever you want.
you should definitely tell her to wait.
tell your partner and understand him well; help yourself to help each other.
my husband and i were married on july _num_, _num_, and we went to hawaii for two weeks.
you should not have intercourse if you are not aroused, as it will be painful.
what do i do with them both?
unless you love it, i would say no.
there are men who do not care what they look like.
where do you want it to go?
maybe it is because he is not alone.
if you have , and he still continues to do it, then let him go, you do not deserve that!
how much success you achieve in your lifetime, and you find love is the reason for that success, it is a great thing.
try being the woman, then i am sure you will find one.
does anyone even know what love is anymore?
it is gross how you do not wipe.
a non desperate guy will not ask you out again if you dumped him once.
we attempt to comfort females.
i will not like the other girl you are with if it is not me.
get a job if you have those types of questions.
ask yourself if he is a decent and nice person.
i have a friend who had the front of her clitoris pierced. it looked very good.
how do i approach a woman and ask her t have sexual relations with my boyfriend and i?
in that case, you know what to do: forgive.
what they said is true.
it does not matter if you are a virgin or not. i just do not want to catch a disease.
suprise her in the middle of a conversation.
if he acts like that, it means he cares for you.
with true love, you will find happiness.
determine whether or not she returns your email missive or discover the result personally.
less taxing to simply continue apace; a pair of unacceptable actions do not constitute a single proper action.
inform those persons that they will fail to make any progress whatsoever by affecting a quality of disingenuousness.
canines are equivalent to family members. believe me, i have the knowledge.
just in the event your heart is desirous of it; if your instinct is to flee, proceed to behave thusly.
of course, stop and say hi!
if they are harming themselves too much to even listen, then go find an adult, possibly a grandparent.
a woman that i know was married to an awful man that beat their kids.
it's because they have a guilty conscience.
the dog was in custody and the children were back in bed when the police left.
if she is not willing to do that, then stop that.
i would like a companion to talk to.
you are completely new to me.
in my opinion, most men are not unintelligent.
if you are a woman and you are attracted to a lesbian, then you are a lesbian.
even if what he says is true, why would he send messages to other women asking for nude photographs?
i very much love my former lover.
do not tell him first. tell your mom, or the social worker for your school and allow them to tell your parents.
it is not as difficult if you know what you are doing.
if it is love, then he will wait. also, he will not cheat on you.
make them laugh and they will love you.
men like him are a waste of time.
perhaps if you enjoy being treated badly.
i would not like to be the seventh man if she is thinking about the eighth.
i will be turning twenty-one this coming august of _num_ on the tenth, that is true
this is the type of love which most people seek, yet are too lazy to earn.
perhaps because they knew that you would be furious.
speak with her and find out if she does like you.
it is a great way to start the day.
he did not take the second chance that i gave him.
she will when she is free if she wants to.
i like it when they lights are on and the woman is on top.
just be a friend to and give him some time and space.
you are starting to hate the friends of the person that you love.
you should do something that most people have not.
i do not believe that love dies so fast.
i think it is just nothing.
she is likely still living with her parents.
this is something you should not do.
she is still with you, so obviously she does.
i would not worry about things like that.
it sounds like he is playing hard to get and you are not.
even chickens care about it.
you get what you put into it.
if you smell better.
you are lucky to not be with him anymore.
what can i do to help her loose weight?
he is not worth your time, you should leave him.
girls want attention, and some good chocolate.
if he becomes too possessive, then tell him to leave.
when you can hear each other without speaking.
you should try it some time. you will not be disappointed.
that is very insensitive of her to do such things in your presence.
other then that, attend a party and court inebriated women.
ask him. you might feel awkward, but the awkward moment will be worth it if he does love you.
say "i love you." if love between you is meant to be, the words will come out naturally.
this action will pay off in the long run.
i am always attracted to boorish men. what is wrong with me?
would i tell my husband to leave?
then you do not have a relationship.
why does my former boyfriend constantly try to make me jealous?
my best friend is male and we have never tried to be more than friends.
it did not, in my case.
take her out, maybe go shopping.
he is dating someone.
tell him that you love him.
my dad acts like that too.
he needs to grow up and mature.
i am not asking him to go out. not even close.
sometimes boys will say things they do not really mean.
she does not care about you, you should find someone else.
if i married the lady of my dreams, that would be everything that i have dreamed of.
you need to get to know her.
i am married, have one child, and desire to be single again.
if you care that much, you should find a new man.
you deserve someone who will not listen to the opinions of others without your permission.
of course you can get in if you are over _num_ years old.
he said, "hey baby, what's happenin'?"
you already had sex with the man.
you can apologize, but you cannot have him back. accept what you already decided.
trying watching an adult movie together.
after you ask the women, why do you not like me?
she has a boyfriend so do not make a move on her.
yes, it could work if you want it to.
it is too late, you missed your chance. she has moved on, now.
you know you are in love if you have sex with them.
i am in your school.
tell him the truth ladies.
do not rush yourself; be patient.
i once heard that that was not true.
avoid the plants i mentioned.
people are just so simple.
it could never be a boring activity.
i've been with my husband since i was _num_, i'll be _num_ next month.
don't buy a woman lingerie unless she asks for it.
i agree, but i don't feel that it is a poor decision.
i asked if she would like to dance, an then we became friends.
you should find and accept this other side of him.
if he doesn't respect you as a person, he doesn't deserve you.
whether my friends agree with this or not, i believe as a friend, i am irreplaceable.
instead of telling him what you enjoy, demonstrate to him what you like.
mrs. right will come along.
they are only using you.
how do you know if it is worth it or not?
to be in your family, i would marry your cat.
before too long you will suck them into your black hole of loving.
all you have to do is ask because i am right here.
get naked and have sex anywhere and everywhere.
you will need good luck.
it isn't right, is it not legal?
my sister has left him since then, but she is pregnant with his child.
a woman knows what i want in real life, correct?
he had relations with his best friend's wife.
do you enjoy hurting those closest to you?
you have to decide you do not want to be miserable anymore.
i would not want or need anything else.
something happenned behind your back?
become a friend to her first.
he will not tell you, because he likes to talk to someone else.
it hurts your partner if you go out for fun when you are in a relationship.
i do not want to see him again.
she might be able to pretend with other things, but that is one thing she can not fake.
you do not know that you have it.
just do not do too much with that much planning!
this is our only issue; we get along great otherwise.
is it time to move to a different place?
ask him, or your friends that know him, and they might now
tell him that you are a beautiful vampire.
i played over half the game because they coaches were more laid back.
i have never stopped loving him, even though we had to part.
start by telling her that you want to kiss her.
do not tell him that you want to make love to him.
are you in love with him?
wait, it will be worth it.
i do not think that you should spend anymore time with him, you do not want to get hurt again.
he can find that with anyone, but you want something more than that, don't you?
make them want to break up with you.
if he loves you, it will break his heart, however he will survive.
you should not be with a man who is going to keep pushing you to do things that you do not want to.
men that have experience do not know which way is up.
get close with math geeks because they know how to handle curves.
you have to overdose to get off.
you have tried too hard.
what was that about because i am curious, too?
an upperclass strip bar with a lot of beer.
i would in a heart beat!
here is not the place to find one.
yes if you lift your butt off of that chair.
it depends on you.
if you never give the relationship a chance, you will never know what would have happened between the two of you.
i have never heard of a guy who did not like doing things such as this.
if he is going through all that trouble to scare you, it is obvious that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you.
things such as this are better to discuss over e-mail.
what was you intent in posing a stereotypical and pointless question?
i just want to help her open up her eyes before something bad happens.
that is not very fair to the guy that you are dating now.
the want a man to be himself, at least that is what i want.
it is just too strange!
good luck with that situation.
it isn't bad if you like him.
he could just be using you for intercourse.
i am sorry, since you're not in love with him you should leave him.
you have every right to be mad.
send the old boy a post card from bora bora or something.
maybe you should tell her and see what response you get.
why would you care, as long as you have yours right?
i agree with you _num_
a hard face to go with it.
i have asked her to be my girlfriend two times already but she never answers.
got anything better to do for the rest of your life other than trying to understand them?
yes, i care, but it is not the most important aspect.
i am twelve years old and recently got a girlfriend.
ask him or tell him that you love him and ask him to be your boyfriend.
no, this is not at all bad.
you already know a lot about each other.
i never speak ill of other people.
you are confusing me, please only ask one question at a time.
i suggest that you cheat on your partner with a prostitute. they have a lot of experience.
not only men, women can have them, too.
number three: do not use intercourse as a weapon in your marriage.
that way you can be with other women and it is not being unfaithful.

leave me alone and worry about you.
he abused me mentally and physically.
i have gone out with larger men.
is your butt in the shape of a chicken's butt?
ask her out if you like her and see where it goes.
tell your boyfriend to tell him that you do not like that man.
no man wants to be friends with women.
or, what is your opinion of marriage?
i would not date an obese man.
you need to stay out of this until things settle down, good luck!
sex and candy, where can i find you?
it is better to loose a lover than to love a loser.
if a man treats me that way, i will just move on.
alright, the way it has always worked for me it to go out with a friend.
first of all, do not do anything which you do not want to do.
as gab said, "no way to know".

do not push the women, they will not respond well.

if you do not act quickly, you might loose the one you love to someone else.
my best friend dates a short guy and kissed him.
you anyone lie about being _num_?
who do guys want from girls?
i asked him that question when we talked last night.

you must trust her.
you can surprise him!
maybe it is time for you to meet the right one.
it is abnormal and not normal.
what were you asking because i am confused.
if he did we wouldn't have looked at the other girl at all.
if i could rearrange the alphabet i would put u and i together.
personally i can't even think of dating anyone.

guy are able to retain female friends as well.
it might not even be that at all, you may find out that you are not even attracted to women at all.
i do think, however, that stupid far exceeds dumb.
the reason is that once they are interested, the pursuit is over.
why would you be interested in someone who is so young or old?
some men have a cute appearance from behind.
if he is trying to exert control over you, break off the relationship.
if you truly like this person, then give it a try.
no, the girl who broke up with me can drop dead for i do not care for her anymore.
there is no doubt about it for i am positive.
i believe "no answer" is your answer, but you just do not want to admit it.

i am in love with my child's father, whom is also my boyfriend!
bear in mind, this guy hadn't been in a relationship for almost _num_ years.
read this article and say what ever you can to stop her.
rather say, who's on your mind?
most men are totally happy, just keep sex interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it.
you should sit them down, let them know that they should be understanding, and support you.
i am his friend. i like him, but he has no idea.
do you have a problem with this?
you should see results in _num_ weeks.
my yahoo identification is a camera.
the man is married for goodness sake.
it is usually the one who is not as good in bed as the other is.
it is never boring. it is actually fulfilling.
the lights of with only a few candles and on top of the blankets.
yes, you can. where were you the day that was taught is sexual education class?
so it is here and you should take it but do not take it for granted.
if they do not then they are not worth your concern over that they think.
why would he ignore me?
i think men with nice bottoms are attractive.
i have male friends that are like siblings to me, with no tension at all.
i have heard a coat hanger, and a vacuum will solve the problem.
you should have made a nice impression on the woman.
gather all of your friends and have a party. allow her to spend time with new people.
the way you spell reveals how worried you are.
it sounds as though you are attractive, so that is a good start.
nobody can do it better than you can.
you are such simple minded people.
a lot of married men are content.
don't act as if you are still a virgin.
i have the same problem, so i sympathize with you.
woman, we apologize that this deadbeat said that about you. the rest of us, think that you all are great.
it does not matter what anyone else wants.

do it in person, set up a dinner date.
if you do not take precautions you will get pregnant.
he is ignoring you for the same reason that we ignore you.
when i went out there, i noticed that.
i am a handsome twenty-eight year old.
tell her to ask him out on a date.
your question is making people aware of the fact that you are unattached.
men's friendships with each other are more important to them than women, the same can be said of women's friendship, no man is worth losing a friend over.
i would not risk my life for anyone, neither friend or stranger.
people do not care anymore about other people.
you tell him it is your way or no way.
call and say hell. be done with it, one way or another.
place your against her vagina.
she is just not that attracted to you.
like me, my love lives far away from me.
what in god's name are you doing?
do not let her play games with you.
it cannot be love because you do not know anything about her.
it is better and easier to tell her over the phone or in person.
you will not find love on the internet.
you cannot make your life all about her needs.
it seems obvious that you should take her out on a date.
you can simply tell them that you already have a date and they should have asked earlier.
it is an easy two points for each of us.
once i said, "well, if there's nothing better to do".
she might have a pre-existing condition that makes her eat this much.

you sneaky guy, i was just going to ask that question.
it is probably the one thing that comes before good health on the human scale of existence.
take her out to dinner, order in with candles and flowers, or treat her like a queen because women like to be pampered.
it is fun and for romantic love.
what do you think?
it is not special or strange because it is your personal choice.
can you check it out quickly for me?
the question that should be asked is, "how do you get your guy to back off the girl?"
i went to one where they had a belly dancer instead and i thought it was lame.
she already knows it is not love.
i would not concern myself with heroin.
i like to laugh and tell jokes.
it cannot be done if they care about you. it is going to hurt mo matter how you say it.
what are you doing?
do not be late, someone else may take the opportunity.
if they are not, then why would they be so rude?
start interrupting him now. that way, when you get married, he will be used to it.
say that you love him/her in order to surprise him/her.
he obviously does not accept you the way you are. how can you remain with him? there is no reason to be miserable.
i believe that they will. why not?
it is hard to return to being friends after dating.
girls show they are more sensitive then boys do.
you need to relax.
go ahead and text the person.
it is not worth sticking with someone who is not right for you.
i do not believe in it in the slightest because it is too commercialized.
perhaps he is only using you.
one might be good in bed, and another good at listening.
youare correct but i nevertheless must do it or she will be angry.
it is whatever you make of it.
why is he sleeping with the dog?
do you dream about her at night?
you have to circulate places and activities you enjoy, and strike up conversation to see what happens.
i do not want to shake your hand, either.
if you are in love you do not want anything else.
i love you very much.
cheer up, do not allow it to bother you too much, and enjoy yourself or go on dates.
i think she is interested in me because of the flirting and personal discussions we have.
relax. do it and realize that is not the best point in your life.
her appearance would not matter.
being eight-years-old is deeply uncomfortable, is it not?
he will propose to you.
then, go ask her out.
perhaps slightly vague on the information.
i have plenty of friends who are men, i also have many friends that are women.
i hope things work themselves out.
you should answer in a nonchalant tone in the future.
as they get married they begin to act volatile and unintelligent.
chances are only once in a blue moon!
what is the worst thing they could say?
my suspicion is that he wants you to have phone sex with him but possibly you aren't interested in doing so.
are you implying that there is something not good about me?
have you read what you have written?
you should take my word for it, priorities are an important quality when considering others.
the cannot see them, but they can feel them.
that should happen, especially if you are looking to get married and settle down.

i tell my boyfriend that i love him each day.
what ought a girl do?
because all men enjoy competing.
you marry the one without whom you cannot live.
do you want male or female friends?
in my opinion, intercourse is meant to give satisfaction, not to receive it.
adam and eve. they were smart, though.
some men do not always care overmuch about intercourse.
i assume you do not look the same to her either if you do not inspire her to impress you.
you can never know. court women, it helps.
yes, i do think there is hope.
obtain a new boyfriend. you are female, so it should be easy.
perhaps you need a man for yourself alone.
if you watch how she responds, that will tell you if she is right for you.
do not have sex if you can not care for a baby.
i would believe what she said to you.
make a nice comment about her hair, outfit, or shoes.
talk to her, then decide where you are going to live.
being attracted to the same sex is not cool.
being intimate with a friend, cab create a rift in the relationship.
at least he wants to to be involved.
do they feel like he isn't confident?
i love my sister, but she gets into unhealthy realtionships.
that is what they called love.
he accepted my newborn daughter as his own.
it is food and sex that will attract your husbands attention.
if you watched spiderman then you should try the upside-down kiss. surprise him when he is unaware and simply kiss him.

i would choose jamookae. he has serious mental problems.
you might have already scared her.
let me guess you moved to new zealand?
tell him that you are the boss or just break up with him and get another man in your life.
personality above all, then a fit body, not necessarily thin, and kindness.
we are a bit eccentric around here.
your mother made the wrong person leave.
if you have not yet had intercourse, do not.
thirteen to have boyfriends but sixteen to go on dates.
by the way which he looks at you and the way he acts towards you.
my father lost twenty pounds by playing outside.
leave things as they are and start anew in a different direction if these do not work out.
why can a man not talk to another woman without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
it means what she says.
i am _num_ and single.
i want to be far enough from my family, but close enough so they can visit.
you can start by saying hi, and having a casual conversation.
they need to compete on the show the biggest looser.
you need to trust your woman, or leave her.
i advise you not to contain anything.

i don't appreciate that ignorant word.
yes, my ex girlfriend stated that as well.

i would guess three to four hundred.
i am too busy to respond to that question.
some men don't function like others.
of course she shouted about it then.
i am letting you know that it was very long.
inform your companion how important they are to you and why.
i completed it and so can you.
if they avoid the question or become angry then i would be concerned.
i assume that you have attempted talking to him.
women like it when you make eye contact.
yes, you should move on and attempt to find a new relationship. there are plenty of single people out there.
i am mixed between the two.

remember the good times and forget the bad but it takes time.

kudos to her for sticking with it even when it upsets her!
it has happened to me once man.
you're the only ten i've ever seen.
what can i do to find out if my boyfriend is in love with me?
it isn't bad, but it does look a little strange if the girl is taller than you.
they cannot, because there is attraction in their hearts.
how could you rationalize doing something like this and then telling other people about it?
if a person does not want to take you out on a date, does it mean that you are unattractive or something like that?
love will find you, so you do not have to look for it.
the problem that i have been experiencing is that i make women angry because i am more intelligent than they are.
you know what he is doing but you do not care because you let him tell you differently.
i think it depends upon how mature the child is.
i say to think long and hard about it.
oh,and also tell your man why you hated him.
i understand that you don't find her attractive, but she is comfortable with herself.
i can fall in love in a short period of time.
it is like suicide, it is normal to think about it, but not to act upon those thoughts.

how can i tell him?
they are only bad news.
i like my men chubby.
just have fun and keep yourself busy.
how to check that i love her a lot.
you can do a lot of things.
men tend to like and whistle at my buttock
now the devil's hell hounds are tracking his every step.
then see what she says and you will have your answer.
is he ruining his life?
yes there are some who are way out there!
i guess if they were not loved they would not find it.
he probably won't want to have sex with you again.
you've decided to leave your wife?
because they are not happy and something in their relationship is missing.
however, he still wants to have sex with you.
i would never pack my husband's bag.
well, this will happen for sure if you really love her.
with kids it is not so simple.
most people do not believe in it until they fall in love.
it is not bad if you have humility.
have a delightful day!
ask if he would like to go somewhere with you.
i am not mixed, but, i am mexican.
i know that it is hard but, it is better for you.
it depends on how old you are.
maybe you just came on too strong, she is not interested.
do not do something which you will later regret.
i am sorry, but i do not know where to find him.
and there are many other men in the world.
no, unless you feel the need to doubt it.
they do nothing for me.
it is odd that someone so young is answering questions here.
that will cost you _num_ points per answer.
why, does it matter to you?
if you want there to be drinks, people will need to bring their own.
marriage can be difficult.
perhaps the husbands are not good enough.
inquire if he is cheating on you.
have your parents hung out with the two of you before?
i am almost twenty years old; how old are you?
it is wet and cool and better if it is forbidden.
you can say it but the question is whether or not you mean it.
he would not think twice about not using a condom.
he broke up with you because of what someone else said!
are you sure that she truly has feelings for you?
yes, but you have to ensure that it is true love.
it can be exciting to be bad once in awhile, especially if you are good all the time.
the first step is to do it five times a day.
i feel you are rather full of yourself.
if he does not do what you want, discipline him.
i think you are jealous because you cannot get a guy.
my grandmother can tell the story better.
i made the right decision. i still see him once in a while.
i forgot to bring some for me.
why did they not tell you?
i hope the girl will not care i have had casual sex before.
the more you think about it being here, the more you are going to want it here.
ask the girl to go to the dance with you.
you need to find a girl that shares the same interests that you do.
and he has a small penis.
i am so sorry, but, that is awful.
please leave her and go on with your life.
i have heard about friends who start dating and find out that they were meant to be.
no, customer care removed it from the answers which is disappointing.
it is her way of showing that she does not want to attract other guys.
i would ask her if she likes you or not.
just be yourself. but it does help to have some money.
do you think she should ask a guy?
the butt is an important feature on a guy. it makes them attractive.
when we first kissed, it send my head spinning for a second!
a sign that he is not cheating, is if his answer is yes.
yes i can hardly wait so that can undo the same to her.
no, not unless they actually said that we were confirmed, then, no.
do not make it seem like you are attacking her weight, it will make her shut down and possible eat more.
it is wrong, women do not commit solely because of money.
i there any chance that they like each other?
be yourself. if they do not like that then they do not deserve you.
your daughter comes first in all aspects of life.
after a few days he broke up with me.
a person is there both when you are happy and when you are sad.
should i leave or stay?
do not be said, because i expect things to get better.
perhaps you become possessive after intercourse and it scare men away.
do not fall totally in love with him.
wow that is really sad, where do you live?
if you do not mind being her backup then okay.
i wish you the best do whats right even though it might hurt.
some women like to please their man so that no one else does.
you are having issues with him.
i believe playing hard to get is your best option.
then again, there are the homophobics.
i want respect and i want him to also be nice.
people who do not understand it are most likely brainwashed.
i stopped a child from doing a dangerous activity in the rain.
it is very important.
ask him straightforwardly if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.
be yourself around her and move on if she does not like it.
i would say no, so get real because this is not a chat room.
you will find the one who is for you.
you do not have to kiss, but you do have to have sex.
give the cat away, steam clean the carpet, furniture, and bed linen, and spray the area to get rid of ticks and fleas.
look those women in the eyes the entire time.
he believes she would not be unfaithful towards him but hates this and it makes him very upset.
it depends on the situation.
hugging him was most likely a bad solution.
and stop letting your husband take the easy way out!
yes, you can fall in love after four months because i did.
maybe one throws bananas at the screen and scratches one's head, but i am just kidding you.
go and get a breast reduction so you feel sexy.
if they are in love with each other, then they will live together.
in the future don't ask ridiculous questions.
my friend always teases my personality.
time is of the essence, you should move on.
ask her is she has have been physically intimate with anyone.
and she does not want other people to say anything.
one time i accidentally proposed to her and she accepted.
court them and discover the truth. you will not know unless you try.
congratulations to him and his bride. she is lucky.
it sounds like you are not, or you wouldn't ask that question.
there isn't enough feelings for him to leave his wife.
i totally agree with you.
i have my own opinions as well.
intercourse is dirty, true intimacy is more fun.
say a prayer to help you guide the best possiblities because people come and go in your life.
do not worry and be mean about it because love is not rare.
he is cheating if he says no.
i was chatting with a man for approximately two hours.
he's not only honest, but honorable. he's not a gigolo or playboy.
he's no longer seeing me.
tell him what you want, basically, and lead him.
be honest with yourself and who you are.
also the penis story as well.
you are not on jerry springer now.
i know, it is easier said than done.
if you were to fall for a girl, would it be for her personaility?
how old are you?
the world if full of guys.
it is probably strange for him.
if so, why can it not survive?
the answer is that life is very good.
if he is doing it on purpose, then you should question it and examine him closely.
i miss him. if anyone knows this man, please send me an e-mail.
inquire if she likes you.
if he is around, make sure she is around as well before going over to her house.
if you like him, why would you not continue?
avoid becoming pregnant if you are not ready to be a mother.
start the day of your wedding.
forget the text stuff and call him at home.
do not listen to these women.
you should and give him his walking papers.
if she broke up with you it was because you were being yourself.
phone sex is an alternative from real sex.
marry her at the courthouse.
wherever you go give her the best of the best!
dress up and have manners if you are a woman.
i'm a pretty girl.
they are not good to have around.
just write him a note.
you should travel to the uk and find out.
i am married, trust me, i know.
no, it complicated things.
i do not understand why you are asking me.
if you are both happy, then do what you know.
he is the one who does not love you!
i think anyone younger than _num_-_num_ years old is not smart.
you know when it just comes to you!
if not then stay with your sister.
firs of all, what is your gender?
this is similar to how i was two years ago.
in order to show their appreciation and make it known that they think of you and care for you.
we are married but she still cannot conceive a child. please offer advice.
i would tell him honestly. he most likely will not care.
it is only what is on the inside that matters.
maybe she does not brag about him to her friends the way she used to do.
okay, so he likes to flirt and he is good looking.
you like him, but you say that he is creepy?
who knows, so you should let them alone.
is the a possibility you could be pregnant?
i like a guy who weighs over _num_ pounds.
she does not want you.
a man can work form sun up to sun down, but a womans job is never done.
there are many men who are, but not all men.
you are a threat, you just do not realize it yet.
i am in agreement with sixteen.
of course i would go; i do not need to be a muslim to attend such a wedding.
you need to try speaking with him first.
please, send me more information if you need help.
sorry if i am not helping, but we can talk further if you want.
yes, you can fall in love after four months. it is possible.
ask your friend to tell him that you like him.
since woman feel that they are mature for their age, why not?
you cannot take the baby back.
it is a beautiful thing to still have your innocence. do not ever feel bad about that.
he needs an outside incentive. you should be the incentive, but some men are imbeciles, like that.
i feel i do not have a chance because another girl likes the same guy as me.
she did that to you?
a woman wants everything from a man.
he is a junior in high school and i am in junior high.
you could ask him.
a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your own child.
you are both naked and in bed together.
it has to be your choice.
sometimes i think about it, and think that it really is my choice.
what is the opposite of above me?
what about all of the women who cheat?
many of my friends' girlfriends ask me the same question.
i agree that the man you are asking about is not a good person.
i know that it is difficult, but you will get over him.
just make sure that you do not get involved in their fights.
you have a large ego.
are you mistaken right now?
if you are in love you will never feel bored, and that is true love my friend.
i do not want her to die.
have caution when you perform it.
now, would i put myself in danger for a friend or a stranger?
if i had that exact kiss today, i would be most disappointed.
and, neither of us could think of anything better to do.
i want work to be done today and forever.
flirt with them and tell them that you love them.
otherwise it is merely something else that may lead to love. you have no way of knowing.
do this either before he leaves or when you initially see him.
we'd go for walks, and she would complain.
no, because he doesn't know her personally if they met on the internet.
he either loves you or not.
it sounds like he already has a girlfriend.
it isn't boring to fall in love.
you only put in _num_ of your efforts.
i am going to personally say yes.
a nice backyard wedding worked for me.
i don't think my bottom looks like a chicken.
it seems that they don't want to be more than just friends.
am i to believe he doesn't have a legitimate reason to dislike you?
smart people are not too smart.
the other saturday i had to pretend to be both a male and female six times.
i do not know, but i think it might be mixed.
i tried it and it does not work.
that would be awful if you broke up after that.
do not have sex if you are under _num_ and still in school.
she will break it off.
give it to her in front of everybody and see what she does.
is he married to a woman?
perhaps they will be convinced one day.
if you know anyone who can make a cake, then you are set.
should i tell my boyfriend that i do not enjoy being in his presence?
why did you leave home the first time?
no, leave him and he will know how good you are.
i do not like seeing her ribs, though.
i do not know except that i am not on the list.
most men are laying dogs.
women can be friends, but men cannot.
when she no longer asks you for any.
at least that way i would get into her.
or such as what you did for class.
it is exciting, especially when you feel butterflies in your stomach.
you have two months, if you want to live in a halfway house.
that being said, even though everyone else is currently dating, doesn't mean there is anything wrong with you.
the abbreviation lol stands for laughing out loud.
the more you keep giving, the more he is goign to take.
i do not believe in infatuation.
if the girls likes you, she will take care of you.
if i wanted it, i would not only want it once.
different men like different things, and i know men that like big women.
make it look like you want her like something else.
it is all about that dollar.
i am sure he will be happy.
men are not strong they are tough.
is she hotter that me.
i'm just to lazy to read it.
do not ignore this or try to play cool.
it is painful, and it is better to wait until you are married.
i am _num_; are you being truthful about yourage?
you are not her type, and i do not believe that she is your type.
don't let him use you, think about your own wellness.
are they disgusting, or wonderful? please elaborate.
men will be jealous that you're interested in him, and not them.
that should not be a factor at all if you like her.
the ones that come from out of nowhere, are the one that are truly genuine from the heart.
there is a girl that i know at my school, she is really nice.
if you can recommend me to some of them i would appreciate it, thank you in advance.
no offense to any good men out there.
my mom's boyfriend and i always argue.
we are not getting any younger, and that is the adventure in life.
i have been hanging out with this good looking guy, and we are getting closer everyday.
you can stand on a chair or walk on stilts.
if you like sports, play volleyball, or basketball.
he would never cheat on me.
i apologize if i missed the point.
or if you are too shy, become involved in activities she enjoys, even if you hate it.
she has realized what she lost and can see how happy you are.
start complimenting him on his appearance.
the dress and bridesmaid's dresses may take you a month alone.
perhaps the same way you told us.
your daughter is acting foolishly. you should tell her so, then be quiet.
he did not consider you at all.
no, they will not go to heaven.
it all depends on the mood that you are in, there are so many factors.
would you go out with me if i am a boy?
i hope he catches on and asks you out!
let things go as they are going.
you need to sign another one every day with each other.
and the only reason i did that is ecause i did not want to feel lonely.
i have a friend who shops there for that reason!
think about what that makes you look like to his friends.
do a good deed every day!
you are so correct that you did the right thing.
i have not done that because i think i would either start laughing or get extremely distracted.
i would not want my wife to have a sexual affair.
you do not need all girls to like you, just one girl.
no matter what, you should stand up for yourself.
i know many women here in the philippines who met someone online and married them.
if he is joking about liking you, then forget him.
we have three children under the age of five, so i cannot spend much time alone with him.
my boyfriend has a very nice buttocks because he exercises.
looking and flirting with other women is not appropriate.
you sister mgiht be able to give you a better answer.
i have the same problem.
it is not necessary, but helps.
it shows that you are over him.
you need to talk to your cousin.
it would be neat.
men and women are different.
i know quite a few decent gentlemen.
you do not know her; but, she has a dirty mind.
probably, they could not stay away from each other for long.
it depends when you get older.
you say that you are seductive and stylish?
you are living in a fantasy.
a lot of thoughts com during the night while you are sleeping.
you should not marry her, she is using you to her benefit.
most of the girls that reside on your campus do not like him.
although, i am glad that i had married him, people are freaking out about that.
my mom was the center of my daddy's world.
do not fall for that.
there are some great looking older men. why do you not look for a younger man?
the woman that you are intersted in is going to be alone and she does not like that.
he attempted suicide and i went to the hospital to visit him.
go and kiss another guy in front of the girl.
if you go out with people whom are unworthy, then you will marry someone who is unworthy.
but it really depends on the woman and her confidence in her natural beauty.
a girl can be beautiful no matter what her size is.
if we slept together, she would find out one way or another.
then see if he still wants to be only friends.
she is a player who just wants a boy toy.
then you can do whatever you feel like.
sometimes even a smart woman goes for a man who is not as smart as she is.
you'll be unable to do what your speaking about.
most men are lying cheating canines.
do you chat in the yahoo chat rooms?
be yourself, be confident, and be honest. if it's not to be, then so be it.
that is the best way to ascertain.
i only say this in a friendly way.
falling in love is great, untill you see reality.
you need to tell him frankly, but nicely.
thirty is a very young age to be gaining so much weight.
i am a male, so it must be sex.
he is not into toys or anything abnormal.
when he starts dating another person.
so, what should i do for her?
hi _num_, it is not simply for lovers.
when you are really in love, you would do anything and everything for that person.
it depends on if you have feelings for her, still.
do not pretend to be something else.
nobody will give you a positive response.
merely say it casually.
love is caring for someone or something which you would not forget.
a song that i cannot stop singing in my thoughts.
if you let him know how you feel and he does not respond, he is not worth your time.
it is hard to avoid.
i like hairy chests and a good chin.
if i did not have kids, i would die for someone i love.
he is sweet, but does not always think correctly.
when you enter into her mind, then, you will know everything.
maybe she feels both ways, one a little more than the other.
i would say that if it is three all together, then, that is cool, nothing is really wrong with that, but, otherwise, no.
how are you trying to fix the the trust, and what kind of girlfriend is she to you?
i feel strongly in my decision to quit the school team.
or do you really love that person?
i hope it all works out, either finding your loved one again or finding a new partner.
if you do not trust him, then how can you be in love?
there is still some hope for these young girls.
yes, you are just confused and do not know what you want at the moment.
unfortunately, my magic _num_ ball says no.
whenever i send a message to him, he ignores it.
love shouldn't be scary, you just haven't meant the right person yet.
i don't find that strange!
speak up for yourself.
i am one hundred and forty seven times stronger than the average man.
if you love him so much then please do.
get out and move on with your lives.
darn, that is a real hard feeling to experience.
i just reunited with my first love, and we talked openly about guilt being the biggest reason for gifts.
it is as people say: there is someone for everyone.
good luck. you will most likely get him.
i cannot because i am almost in love.
whatever you decide to do, stop giving in and having intercourse.
he may be sensitive or merely waiting for someone to love.
my friend likes a man who told her he would like to get to know her better.
furthermore, you do not need special shoes.
was his response that you should stay the cours, that he was mistaken, or that he did not love you?
i am in doubt and suggest you behave.
if they love you, they will accept you in any case.
you clearly acted correctly.
you should walk up to her, tell her you like her, and ask if she likes you.
why are you unable to do it?
is it worth it to you to try it?
so be it if killing himself is the only thing to make him get over this.
do not hurt his feelings and keep quiet.
you could e-mail him if you cannot do that.
i have all of the qualities above.
i recommend telling him directly. it is better to hurt someone sooner rather than later.
it does not have anything to do with you, though.
it sounds like he is very interested in you.
she likes to dye her hair different colors.
i believe that females also do it.
do married woman still perform oral sex?
my premonition says you'll be married as soon as you decide to do so.
some men just behave that way.
it is a narrow way of thinking that god does not care about sexual proclivities.
my friend told me when i first saw that word.
why can she not see because we all can.
if you want to have sex for more than five minutes at a time do not have children.
can you go up to her and ask her?
how can i handle thi situation?
do you know how i overcame it?
friends, does the following sound familiar to you?
try it. you may find that you enjoy not being consumed with sexual desire.
i can't tell what you are saying, but it is profoundly true.
tell her not to date any bad men.
that is what make girls happy.
you did not say if your wife has children.
i got offered to stay the night at a girls house that i know.
tell him that you love him.
i dislike wearing flat-heeled shoes and i will not do it simply to make a man feel better.
you must desire to let go and move on or you will not be able to do so.
be genuine, but do not talk too much or be too promiscuous.
no, but that would be amusing because i am six feet and two inches tall.
no matter how long it takes to stop caring about them.
try to be his friend if he still does not.
does he care about things related to your knot?
men are hunters like dogs where the chase is what they are after.
he wants you to do this so that he will feel comfortable messing around, too.
i wear glasses and i have had boyfriends.
women like women. it is common, and for some it will fade.
i am attracted to homer simpson.
i already said that.
men think with their groin, and it gets boring.
you can't stop thinking about the person you love.
we only get touched for times a wekk.
thank you for helping me plan my wedding!
women love when you're obtuse.
point to the area where you want your man to place it.
see what gets you more angry.
think about children after you ask him to marry you.
has she halted sleeping with you?
they are very nice.
regardless of sex, god is happy when two people have mutual love.
support her if she is fine with her appearance.
unless i realized that i did not want it.
i could help if i knew who she was.
my suggestion is to not be serious about becoming serious.
if he did it once, will he do it again?
somebody is there for your good and bad moments.
what should i expect from my boyfriend if i go?
not even free lunch or fireworks.
if you do not, then you will never have contact with him.
particularly attractive men tend to be vain.
at most, three to five years older than you.
both are nice. it depends on what kind of mood or day we are having.
that is where i often talk in yahoo chat for my state.
if you do not use it, then you lose it.
i do not know how you feel about that, but i think it is disgusting.
save yourself from heartbreak and find a nice man.
i did quit and then joined a recreational team and i had much more fun.
if he is married then you should not even be friends.
if she asks me and i do not know the answer
yes i have a lot of chances
i sympathize with you because i am going through the same thing right now.
wait just long enough so that he does not think you are promiscuous.
if she wants to confuse you, i suppose it is time to leave her for someone new.
are you listening to yourself?
i suppose it depends on if you have ever committed a felony.
yes, but i have not yet met a person for whom i would die.
she should ike you for who you are.
it should be normal to talk on the phone.
do you mean it?
i am married a handsome, but mean man, and ended up divorcing him.
obesity is the second largest killer in young people now.
he says you don't actually love him, because you've only called him twice?
stand your ground, and let him know it is over.
pity won't get you a partner.
my boyfriend releases a lot of gas from his body frequently.
my friend confessed that she loves me.
if you just live your life, you may learn to enjoy it.
have an outing with them.
if your feelings are sincere, then you should try it.
perhaps for no reason other than excitement.
our family hated the fact that it was an interracial relationship. my father and his grandmother were very upset.
before doing so, visit a flower shop and surprise her with flowers.
please do not try that. you will die.
grab his genitals and you will own him.
i hope i was helpful.
no, i do not care about my boyfriend.
seducing a woman is a wonderful feeling of achievement.
i personally do not focus on men's rear ends.
you do not. you go on with your life, pretending you do.
because when one hurts you, you will have another to visit.
do not be afraid to tell him what you want.
men appreciate a small amount of mystique in a woman.
without intercourse, there is one less piece of evidence that two people like each other.
if it is during sex, then she is not a virgin.
the problem is that i do not know if she likes me or not.
if he loves you, he would care even if it is just a petty thing.
first of all,the man did not do it to you.
and he does not notice that?
do you still love him?
this is how my wife keeps my attention!
tell her to get a life.
what can i do for fun with her after school?
the world is going to end because you asked an unintelligent question like this.
p. s. i am not criticizing or labelling you at all.
do not ask via text as that is just lame.
my man loves me and i hope your man loves you.
it would look funny but it is fine as long as you two love each other.
maybe he just does not want to talk.
if it is againt your religion, i do not have an answer for you.
i do not know the person you met.
do not make yourself seem cheep. married men are not avaliable!
you are in trouble.
some people need a push.
you both need to be understanding and able to adjust.
i am a decent guy.
you will be ok do not worry, and i agree with him that something is making you feel bad.
this means that she is interested in you.
ninety percent of the time what you like seeing him in, is not something he is comfortable in.
try thinking about another woman.
boys are more sensitive but they dislike showing it because they think it is feminine.
i need somebody that i can really care for.
it seems that you know nothing about women.
do not buy women clothes unless she picks them out. you do not know what will look good on her.
love her and trust her, and she will love you more.
some say if they ask for forgiveness for being homosexual, god will allow them into heaven.
admit that she doesn't want to date you.
if your girlfriend loves you a lot, then your past shouldn't be an issue.
yes, men are physically stronger, i can admit that.
how do i inform him?
stop asking questions such as "how do i cause women to like me?"
there may be some reason for this type of behavior.
list as many of them as you would like.
if it has been a long time, then you should say no to that.
i have been married three times and have two sons.
no one knows as in the end it is all up to you.
but if you really want to know, then just ask her.
always remember that there are many other people who would be willing to be with you.
you should go on a date with a man in whom you are interested.
by asking him if he still finds you desirable.
i learned it in school and i am good at problem solving.
he seems like a very rude person.
i am _num_ years old, call me.
that can make the phone slimy, and smell funny.
you mom has kicked out out, so he has no say in your life anymore.
do not allow anythign to happen that you do not want to.
it can be scary, risking your feelings and heart, and leaving it in the hands of someone else.
if you work at it, it will continue to grow forever.
it is pleasant and a pleasure to be married.
it is okay to be emotional while talking to her.
you want your cousin's love.
email me the answer at "teshtad@yahoo.com."
i feel she would leave if she did not love you.
if it takes too long to be ready, most girls may find it odd.
enjoy life because you only live once.
has there ever been a woman who you liked but not enough to go out with?
wwarnsley's answer is a correct one.
i did, and we are still together, too, half a year later.
i believe he has didtent because he feels bad.
be careful, otherwise you may have a problem.
sometimes you have to show men what it is that you like.
i invested in a food business. it is also rather good.
i am interested in a woman who attends the same school as me.
you appear strange. stop sending her text messages.
who is gwen stefani married to?
walking will take some of this mental weight off.
we have been talking for four and a half months.
what are you waiting for? pursue him!
when a woman looks at you, she is testing you.
i am a boy. i know what you should do.
it is a chess cake, much better.
likely not, but again, i do not think i would want him to.
you should get him drunk and remove his clothes.
to you a woman, do, say, or look like in order to be beautiful.
some can not live without it while others can.
that is correct, so go out there and explore.
it is not a bad situation.
it must be something that is in the water!
it does really matter how tall he is, the most important fact is that you two are in love with each other.
if you are a man, then you should act like a complete gentleman.
i am uncertain as far as the love thing goes.
it was about ten years ago, but they still really love each other.
sometimes it feels really bad, but it will be when it is meant to be.
boys want to become men. men want women.
that made me really upset.
you can hug him, look into his eyes, and tell him you love him and say his name.
you have the right to go on a date.
it is not so bad if you are twenty-five and he is thirty-four.
no one knows this woman's intentions, but if she loves him she will wait.
it is not for you.
we all go to his school.
try and observe his actions.
men like younger women. i am not looking for a woman my age.
maybe his wife does not seduce him like she used to.
you need to make her realize that she is too important to you, and that you are the man of her dreams.
try to smile before you look away, so you do not make the girl think you believe she is ugly.
i am smart, but i do not think i am smart enough for him.
that just means that you like to see yourself.
i hate to say this, but it is going to get worse once you are married.
however,if not then he is not worth it at all.
put an ad in the washington post.
are you two even married?
then they might pursue you and if not it was just not meant to be.
you have become just another sexual escapade.
watching a woman masturbate is enjoyable. after she finishes, i will immediately have relations with her.
i do not want to be annoying.
at least i would and it does not cost a thing.
why are men stronger and tougher, more honest and responsible, and hardworking?
i really look for a married man.
what can i do when i see her being so upset?
but i do not have a lot of money for the clothing,flowers,catering, and everything else that goes into a wedding.
maybe i can help since i speak the language of idiots, grunts, and jabberwockys.
what is it so hard to understand that they man just wanted to have sex with you?
you should like yourself, or what you look like?
can you have a nice conversation about it?
you should try the milk before you buy the cow.
he tried to love me, but he can not express love.
do you want to see what is on my hard drive?
why would he go to jail?
let your family know that person makes you happy.
wait because you are still a child.
you should make the first move.
if i had met the woman of my dreams, then she would be everything that i need.
it is fine to like him even though others do not.
why do men lie so much?
tell them you do not want to have sex.
it is better to let go.
you should not second guess what you do together if both of you are okay with it.
unless it is one sided love, i would do anything to the extent of giving my soul away.
if only i knew the answer.
he plays with his little buddy while he is playing.
we admit to being simple creatures, while some people are creepy.
there is no way to know that.
it may not be love that you are feeling but possibly some other strong emotion.
i had one date with this man who seemed very nice over the phone.
he is a _num_-year-old guy who is a virgin.
you could tell her that you have been with him and he gave you an std.
do it for your country.
have them take a quality lie detector test.
please help me out, this is a problem to me.
they are a big part of your life as well.
when he screams "where's my razor?"
go up to him and tell him your doubts.
sure, as long as you like him.
i still know a girl who's looking for mister right.
it will be painful either way.
do not be unintelligent. be average in intelligence.
rent everything and have one of your family members take photographs and recordings.
because trust me, you will regret it later.
in my opinion, fifteen and sixteen are rather good ages.
i am scared or shy!
think of the problems he would face if he was dating a girl in junior high.
it might be hard, but try to act as if you do not want it.
you should try love because it is not bad.
avoid simply transferring it from yourself to her.
negative, assuming the pair of you have passed the age of consent.
request her contact details. if she fails to provide them, the obvious conclusion is she has no affection directed at yourself.
inform him that you maintain your feelings in love for them using any possible method.
should he fail to respond forthrightly, or initiate obfuscation tactics, you're aware of your prescribed course of action.
it depends on how long you have been with her.
if she ignores you, then forget about her.
if he only likes her a little bit, then he should not get very upset.
the two of you need a marriage counselor or a larger bed.
clubs and groups are places that i suggest, and good luck and have fun.
spend plenty of time with your girlfriends, have fun, and allow yourself to be around other men.
did you catch him or did he volunteer the info?
go out with your friends and have a excellent time.
i made a mistake, and now i really love my wife very much.
oh, yes, there must be a great sense of humor, self-confidence, and a kind nature.
it is the holy grail, my friend, and i wish i knew.
is it normal to have sex with your boyfriend?
however, i have learned that a man will show it if he really likes you.
okay, i have been there and done that, dear.
i have too much for which to live.
where do i go for help?
my advice is to tell him that you must respect your best friend and he should respect you.
bring him to a nice bar whereat you can play darts and billiards.
you are mature and attractive.
do i have to get over my crush?
flirt a little bit.
i would not be able to live with her death.
do not hurt her. there are a lot of men out there.
it depends on the choice, but i like the dog style too much.
what happens if the relationship does not work out?
you should be having sex like rabbits.
you women are too paranoid about everything.
maybe there really was not that much love there when you got married...you just thought there was.
then you can certainly do these things together!
tell me what you think because i hate valentine's day.
just be yourself and enjoy the things that you like.
do that only if you want your friend to watch.
we have phone sex everyday and never get tired of it.
that will make it worse.
you have to treat him like you would a good friend you have not seen in such a long time.
if you are truly her friend, then, you would not even consider it!
i am almost to the point where i do not care to take another go at it.
no, but when you are in love, intimacy will feel like a totally different experience.
people who feel like they are inadequate, often do not like people with inadequacies.
yes, i used to do it all of the time.
that is a good question. i could not think of one thing.
if you do not want to have sex, then i do not see a problem.
would you enjoy it if your future husband cheated on you?
i like famous singers, and i have seen you on a cd!
why not if he loves her?
why can you not ask her out?
get ideas off of the knot website.
in my opinion, you should end the relationship.
there should be no reason why you should not persue a realtionship with him.
you need to end this relationship.
are you sure you want to marry a man who is on trial for two attempted murders?
tell her no unless your feelings change.
a brief story about you and i can help you.
if all he wanted was to make-out, he did not truly love you.
i know my ex did the same thing to me.
choose yes, for tyhe long term, and no, for the short term.
yes, it depends on how long you have been acquainted.n getting married
no, he should wait on getting married to her so soon.
my girlfriend likes butts.
do not be so possessive with him.
i would enjoy it if she pleasures herself in front of me.
do you like bad boys?
men do not appreciate women telling them what they need to do.
do you want to come sit in my cock pit?
in my opinion, it is rather strange.
she cannot stop you from seeing your phallus.
even if his phone is silent, he can see the missed calls.
leave her and do not look back.
if she is shy, she might like you alot.
you can start anytime if you have protection.
keep playing the game untill you get to level _num_
one was a wolf, the other a rather large labrador retriever.
some men do and others do not.
this sounds strange but attempt to watch both kinds of pornography: one homosexual and one heterosexual.
if the man treats you well, then what does his buttocks matter?
i praised my god because she became my wife.
you can tell him any time. he will most likely do it if he is not homosexual.
i did not believe until i saw her eyes.
perhaps she is intentionally making it difficult for you or she is interested but does not want to admit it.
would you like to talk about what is going on?
why do the females there have facial hair?
things get lost, but memories are more difficult to get rid of.
you should definitely considering asking your older sister again.
you should surprise her with it and give her small gifts during the dinner.
he is aware he does not know me personally.
in my partner's eye i am.
if you can both wait, then it is worth it.
i used to be like that.
you will never find peace if you keep him around.
forget all about him, don't go out of your way to make him think your over him.
i hope not, i have enough trouble with gays making googley eyes at me on earth.
it means she probably wouldn't have left you if you would have chilled out.
maybe you married the wrong guy.
well yes, but i hope i never have to.
women want it more than men, and they are saying, "no."
you do not want to spend the rest of you life wondering about it.
you can go somewhere else with boyfriend when you bath have the time.
sex is one of the most important things a man can do in life.
you might have tried to do or be that if you knew.
what should i do?
youc an not wait for prince charming to find you.
find a lover, but keep your boyfriend.
i believe he is seeing a non-respectable woman.
how can i approach her?
remove anything and everything that is associated with him.
i am curious as to what this was all about.
are you certain that is what you want?
it is simple, just do not do it.
no, are you a man or a woman?
most people do not even get there.
are you and your spouse still together?
is putting a ad in the local paper something we can do?
i believe we are standing between heaven and hell.
tell him to leave her alone and look for something else.
love cannot be bought by money; but sex can, which it seems that is what you want.
she is not even in college, yet you want a serious relationship?
we should thank him for the enjoyment of sex.
if you want it to be special, do not buy her edible underwear!
last recourse. cling and pray to jehovah god and to his son, jesus christ!
do they really love you, or they just say they love you?
i do not think so, unless you are trying to commit suiside?
great kisser, but pleasurable sex is nice as well.
my friend hasn't the slightest idea, that she has ruined my life.
how else could you be but straight forward?
if he truly loved you he would not have wanted you to have an abortion.
if you truly love him, go to him and elope.
that is when you need to relax.
i like a guy with a great body.
what a tangled web you've weaved!
why not ask him to an engagement?
i personally would want my daughter to be a homosexual. i comprehend how men are.
it won't be illegal. that would be holding an individual for ransom, instead of dating her.
ask a question and you might get the answer.
some people are just too ignorant for anything else.
you ask her and see if she replies honestly.
but i think it is unfair.
if one did not enjoy using intimate toys, than apparently it did not help them.
i recommend asking "what if we were married one day."
you should just be yourself and stop worrying about pleasing human beings.
you are already married, so what is the problem?
you cannot train them to put the toilet seat down, and you certainly cannot change their minds.
i have been in that situation.
trust me even though i know it is quite a bit to remember.
help me answer the question what needs to be done.
why not? a woman married a dolphin.
what turns me off is bad breath, body odor, and excessive farting and belching.
if you have back pain then get a breast reduction.
not all married men cheat, and i did not because my wife was my life.
peach fuzz is okay, but not a hairy like a man's chest can get.
are you suppose to sign that?
my neighbor says that she is playing with you.
since you have a long history with him, you know what he is really like.
another alternative: you could say, "hey, sexy, want to go for a soda?" but i jest.
i think i don't become much concerned about it.
on the one hand, he is an inspiration. on the other hand, i don't want to get involved. yet i would love to become close. what do you suggest?
finally, the muslim question is hilarious.
i am sure that's what a man would want.
i have the same idea about wrestling.
it is not your fault that they are not strong minded.
why did you enjoy doing it?
if they do, then ask him to hang out.
yes, the woman i love is worth dying for. if she died, i would not want to be alive, anyway.
if you want to be girlfriend material, be yourself.
are you an alien? you do not know how important sexual relations are?
you should ask him out, men like it when we do that.
i want to do it very much. i do not just want to do it.
if so, how often, why, or why not?
get a younger man for goodness sake.
you notice her appearance and nothing else.
do not give up or become crestfallen. you are a good person.
when a person is as attractive as you are, it is worth the effort.
yes, of course, with a poem written on the cake.
what is a relationship if you cannot talk to one another about the things bothering you?
it cannot be hairy.
you will know because you will feel it.
i would not doubt him.
it is akin to how ours go to their breasts.
what is wrong with you?
that sounds great except for the _num_ month situation. give it some time!
honestly, the best way is to just tell them.
ask if you're not sure.
tell your parents you love them, and continue on.
god doesn't mind, love is love.
boys want sincere and caring females who can accommodate to a man's life and nothing else.
they feel like they are no longer needed by their husbands.
pay attention to your gut feelings.
open it and ask her just like you've demonstrated here.
i am unsure of that.
think hard, what is her favorite restaurant, coffee shop, vineyard, etc.
none of the above. ask me about large or small men and i will tell you.
i do not wish to be mean, but it sounds like he may have some issues with cheating.
i dislike this day also.
you have a big problem if you are under eighteen.
maybe that is who he is.
i love sex and cannot get enough of it.
go on a date with him once, and stay with him if you like him.
you should ask her politely why you have not heard from her in years.
first, get divorced, then show the other lady she is not worth the trouble, and then you are done.
the position they enjoy is the best is walking upright in the shopping mall with your money.
no, it is not wrong because you do what you have to do.
you can have intercourse if you choose.
she sees you as nothing more than a friend.
yes, it is the french which everyone was using; however, this also works.
however, remember that dating does not have to mean a committed relationship.
everyone wants to obtain the perfect man, but no one is willing to be one.
act as though she is one of your friends.
if he leaves you, then he was not meant for you.
nut women do not care as much as men do.
i am in a relationship with another woman and i have already met her parents and they like me very much.
i would be in front of you, if i knew!
just stop wasting time, and talk to him!
if being apart makes them happy, then you should be happy for them.
what would be a good gift for a girl who does not know that i am attracted to her?
trust me, you will be asked on dates soon enough.
i suggest you refrain from doing something you would regret at a later date.
you should not pay attention to him; he is giving you bad advice.
you should be more careful next time and prevent yourself from being hurt.
i do not think anything happenned.
that is in the same house where he is living.
do you think she has somethign to hide?
wear soemthing attractive, make yourself pretty, cook his favorite dinner, and then make love.
sometimes, you can not go home.
be sure that you do not take it too far.
it is definitely oxygen. without oxygen you cannot live for very long. nice question, aurora.
this question is for women especially: have you ever been in a relationship with a man who you did not know well?
also, take some time to learn how to use chop sticks if you have not done so already.
it depends on your gender.
somewhere inside yoursef you are strong and that will make him weak!
make her think you do not even think about her at all.
if you are already sexually active with the man in any case then the best choice is to have sex.
i can lend you a few.
begin by kissing and then proceed to doing a bit more.
both of you need more freedom from the relationship in order to achieve closure and proceed with your lives.
you should inform her of your feelings.
i would not be agitated unless an unseemly person was watching.
what makes her want to look?
we're bad liars... men are much better.
yes, people have wed in prison.
i suggest you put yourself in their shoes.
they will always be that way.
i got a labrador retriever and i love him.
dreams do not mean it is going to happen.
it was an eye opener for me.
though it is not true. therefore, if she lies, then it is only about men and liking her.
you do not have to aske her specifically to be your girlfriend.
she likes you as though you were her brother.
only one. the first and the last.
continue searching for someone to love.
is it too far out of your way?
that's how i envision it.
they need to be in the mood for love, then relax.
do not let it bother you.
do you have confidence with each other when things are terrible?
employ a replacement individual to inform him on your behalf.
roses have a singularly reddish hue, violets sport a bluish coloring.
if you fancy the man, vocalize the affirmative. if you're not romantically interested, respond in the negative.
we also possess hormonal systems, for your information!
do you get it now?
we are both _num_; i am somewhat low on funds, and he enjoys chocolates, but are chocolates too trite?
if you do not know then i will not tell you.
it sounds as though he may have found another way to please himself.
if it is painful, it is too long.
be yourself and see what happens.
that is unacceptable; perhaps you just have issues with asian women.
it means that she likes you as a brother.
are you referring to time or longitude?
no, not really, but if you do become pregnant, the infant can be stillborn or have birth defects.
of course, it is the feeling that counts.
do not give into him easliy, it will quickly give him control.
i love a man who is not afraid to show his sensitive side.
i had the chance to read what you have, but thank you for the ideas.
i married my high school girlfriend's sister.
it is best that your partner is also your best friend.
if you are worried about no commitment, then you should talk first.
i do not have my girlfriend wait on me.
dream of me for four years, the hop on my boat.
do not have sex with for a bit and it will drive him insane.
do not go back out with her.
he wants to break up. you are boring him and he is cheating with someone else.
look for a person who wants to spend their future with you.
this wedding clearly is not about you.
i hope you find this answer to be useful.
i intensely want to resume our relationship.
later, see if he wants to remain in your presence.
in your case i am similar to your girlfriend, and you're similar to my husband.
why don't you let the drama add up?
think wisely, you don't want to ruin a friendship.
women who don't have a pleasure spot, can still enjoy intercourse.
is he a person who rents our prosritutes?
i have learned many things on here that i did not previously know.
protect yourself now and go through channels to cover yourself.
look out your window because i am there.
of course. why would you ask me that question? that means you are one.
just curious as to whether any women have advice about having sexual relations for the first time?
listen to your heart and your mind.
since you gave me a negative answer, here is yours: maybe it is because you are older than you say!
online chat invitations are dangerous! get a real life.
you have to ask, hey?
is there something unique and not ridiculously pricey?
you do not have to pay back state and federal grants.
i am in my mid-twenties. i am still a virgin.
i did not know until now, but here is one for you.
men are so good at this, there is simply no comparison!
most boys act ignorantly around women they like.
that means the person in question loves you and wants you back.
i'm only seeking female input.
i agree with the previous commenter: it's time to get that fixed.
intercourse is merely intercourse, not a major concern.
not unless her age is twice your age.
you refrain from doing so. what is your behavior meant to be, inquiring as to that type of information?
only if they desire the circumstance to as great a degree as you.
in the event your sensation is that he's doing so, it's most likely that he's doing so.
come to henderson, north carolina; there are sufficient amounts of them here.
there are many young women on earth.
first, go out in the rain; then ask your partner to carry you and become comfortable.
ask him where he sees his life going.
you can always try to invest in stocks and bonds.
you will be able to tell if you look into his eyes.
touching has no language barriers. it can also lift a persons spirit.
then jon asked me if i would be jealous if he went out with this woman, alyssa.
how can i get paid through the internet?
it hinders you from doing enjoyable things with people.
do not worry, you should grow up and grow out of that.
a better question is why is he your boyfriend?
it depends on the size of the penis.
i want to try and make things exciting.
yes, if i was trying to get out of the relationship.
be loyal, nice, friendly, and sweet.
your story is similar to a television series.
how can i respond if i do not know your gender?
every person controls his/her own life. unfortunately, most do not practice that enough and look to others for help.
raise yourself, because he has no obligation to feed you.
then, if you have not already done so, visit a doctor.
he will get jealous. tell him you do not like it.
we can talk about this subject later.
i know that you like this girl.
respond so they will know how many guests to expect.
what does that mean?
do not go back for him.
it did in my head.
i do not know how i will get over him.
it only works in bad teenager movies.
who is more important to you?
are you not answering your own questions?
by all means, do not participate in it during your menses, because that is just unseemly.
if he will not sit with you, then you know it is just a friendship.
we have had many ins and outs.
it feels stupid to break up now as we have spent so much time together.
how do i stop being a jealous girlfriend?
who goes on in mens' heads?
i need your help, and it sounds like you need a male's perspective.
you already know the answer.
would you date a girl who was a stripper?
it is much better. you will see.
it pays to send in a video of yourself having sex.
why not simply tell her the truth?
it is not a sin. also, you can go as far as you want.
send me an e-mail. if you live close enough to me, i will take you on a date.
break up with him. he is obviously not interested.
ask him to spend time with you, then begin to flirt with him and see how he responds.
i need many answers so go ahead.
sexual activity with my attractive man (i was not required to provide him to others).
that you are the sole, singular individual.
save for your closest companion making this suggestion, my opinion is under no circumstances.
hey, brother, if you do not have a miami address, you're best served by traveling to this location. it is the most ideal.
i reccommend that you call her and inform her of your feelings for her.
this man and i got close over the past few weeks.
are you sending him the wrong messages?
do not tell them you are a virgin.
i love not having to worry about anyone but myself.
i do not enjoy big breasts.
that is cool dude, and i still have a long way to go, but thank you for the _num_ points.
that is one thing that love is all about, honestly.
when he knows i am not looking, he will stare at a woman and be checking them out in front of me.
i would probably break up with him for that.
women want a challenge, not a guy that is easy to walk all over.
it is because nobody has done it to them, so they do not know how it feels.
we are better liars than men.
do you not have male friends who you do not go on dates with?
if you are not hiding things, showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
my difficult is, i always see others the way i want to see them.
to get over him, simply play with young men.
"i know he is unpleasant but he says he wants to be with me."
you should break up with him because you are wasting you time if you stay with him.
if a man/woman cannot be honest with you, then forget him/her.
it is going to remain a mystery to all.
i promise that i will not bring my friends along.
she knew that i was there and that i love her.
her body language will let you know.
it does not mean that he does not love you.
i like him, and he likes me too.
i like dark hair, dark eyes, nice skin, and a nice butt.
either he is busy or he is not worth your time.
spend some time with him and discover what his personality is like.
the waves in boracay do not get that high even though it is raining.
you know they are merely dreams.
and will i always have problems with having barely enough money to cover cost of living?
you take it slow and try to make it as close to perfect as possible.
it is because their head is not on their shoulders.
no, i know jim. he is.
do you not love it when a man does what was expected?
a dinner date on a cruise ship is so sweet.
if you like him and know he is the one, do not do it because you are wanting affection.
if it doesn't work, speak to a acquaintance. not about him.
do you have a website photo page, or similar?
honestly, i prefer men that haven't been with many women.
you are among the worst people in the world.
it simply means that they are being serious about their sexuality.
different times are for different women.
it depends on your relationship.
if you someone, they will love you back.
i think he will cheat you sometime because he already cheated your cousin.
i am a relationship doctor.
i still think of him.
just pretend that he doesn't exist.
no, but who is truly happy?
it is easy to say yes, but i feel that it would be tough.
you don't need to worry about anything.
that shouldn't be a problem.
that does not mean he is putting the moves on someone else. i would be suspicious, though!
well, do not show off. that is a turn-off, and will give the impression that you are arrogant.
realize that mother and father are happy being separated.
how would i get it to come out, again?
you are a man, and love is a very complex thing.
whatever, he is not a smart guy anyway!
if it does not mean anything, why is she going out with another girl?
please do not do this. you deserve so much better. you can but please don't.
asian women are like women of older generations.
let her know that it bothers you. if she continues, run!
i will wait until she is ready to wear a bra.
i prefer to find someone that i can talk to.
make him think you're interested in his best friend.
send your ex a valentine's day gift.
it isn't over until i say it is over.
click on my avatar and check out my questions. they are the same!
do not say that because most men are not stupid.
you are making me very tired
does it matter if you are shy?
if i get broken up with over it, then i deserve it.
it does not mean he does not care about you.
most people who are bad at kissing are that way because they do not know it.
no, move on with your life. i have been through this before.
if you no longer doubt him. you instincts are the best indication.
dark hair and eyes with olive skin.
if you think he is attractive and have feelings for him, try asking him out.
i only care about her.
i think that was too risky.
love can lead to heart ache.
i will talk to you later about this.
i guarantee someone has feelings for her, but she is missing them due to her obsession with this man.
i am unsure, but if you find mine please let me know as i would like it returned.
they do not want to be your friend anymore?
it is not a good idea unless you have the perfect partner.
did you ask him what lead him to cheat?
this is too revealing for my taste.
even today their material is bogus.
at that point distract her and leave.
you should ask him to join you at dinner or a film.
love them because god loved you first.
so you can learn from it.
it is the same reason that most women are stupid!
learn how to spell because i cannot understand your question.
find someone better, someone you deserve.
i am not sure but you have to be careful.
it is not all about how long, it is about how long and how thick!
try expressing how you feel with a card.
get something that he would like to see you wear.
do not force it, because you might make a mistake.
why would she miss someone she was not dating?
my breasts are too big for this shirt.
i see it everythere online.
that is not very attractive.
talk this issue out, before you make a mistake.
tell her that you are the man of her dreams.
how old are you? i would like to be your friend.
you have to get out of there quick.
they do not think the same way you do.
you have to move on with your life and find someone new.
i believe you have a boyfriend.
i had one of those with your mom.
do other girls feel the same way?
how many minutes into the first date did you mean?
i like him, but i do not know if he likes me.
sometimes, it does not matter if you know how to use it.
what kind of friend are you looking for?
do you perspire much?
lately he avoids me, he won't speak to me.
attempt an erotic dance, sexy.
i like girls who have nice personalities.
i like school teacher, but i am not a teacher myself.
sometimes he acts as though he still does.
it depends on how far you would let me go
he is trying to be with another woman so i would take a step back.
have a happy valentine's day!
i am always happy waking up in the morning. now, i am at work.
have i told you lately, that you are cute?
if things do not work out, keep your head high and do not give up.
there are some good country boys out there that would love to have a good country girl.
ask her out on a casual date.
do not encourage your girlfriend to become an exotic dancer.
that description sounds surprisingly similar to flirtation.
my boyfriend truly enjoys my toes.
if you love someone, then you sacrifice being with other people.
good luck and have a nice day.
when i had intercourse with a man who worked diligently.
is he still interested in me or is he only pretending?
if you love someone, then it is for their personality, not their race.
there is no false love, so "true love" is a euphemism, i suppose.
if you only want your ex, then leave the rest, alone.
there is no need to keep playing games.
you are unattractive. he may not have had a choice but to look.
you should talk to her and ask her out to dinner or a date.
if she enjoys your company, then great.
come on, things are fine now
just say that you would like to kick it some time!
first of all, do not call them stupid and ugly just because they like you.
maybe he thinks it is your fault that you have a baby.
you cannot really tell that soon, i do not think.
if she is getting jealous, then there must be a reason why.
he needs to see what it is like firsthand.
you should find me to have some fun.
you see him more at night. that is when your father is sleeping.
you are a beautiful person. go out and have fun.
do not let the girls lie to you.
that was a question that leaves you laughing.
you are a truly sad dilemma.
you can even tell him why, if he asks.
what if the people were men.
it is not going to last so go out and have some fun.
no, do not ask him. instead, just push his buttons so that he will ask you out.
you are different than everyone else.
if you look straight into his eyes, you will get an answer.
do we want our moms to be liars?
find out what his love language is, and speak it.
do you want to spend the rest of your life with someone like that?
every time i speak about it, he says i am pushing him.
i would think that he is being intimate with someone else.
i come back to my home town sometimes, simply to get away, which is across the country from him.
remember he needs to help pay for your expenses, also.
you laugh out loud and you should feel better.
he is a man, what were you expecting?
it sounds as if he enjoys your presence, but you can never be too sure.
why is skin color an issue?
go to the wedding regardless of your feelings.
my contact information is _num_@yahoo.com. i enjoy meeting new people.
if a person of color breaks into my house, is it fair to assume they are all criminals?
do not be weak.
i want a woman who is loud.
does he have money and is single?
they better not cheat on you and write you a note about it.
i do not think we will lie to you if you ask him.
do not let him weigh you down.
that man is a psychopath and very controlling.
i went with my boyfriend to the place we were goign to eat at.
but there are no men in this town worth dating.
i want her to want me.
you should not think that because then everyone, like me, will think you are stupid.
did his boss berate him?
and she has this constant fear.
beautiful women can be found everywhere. examine the world around you.
because the distance makes lies harder to hide.
i expect he will go to jail even though you say it was mutual.
by the way, all those commercial saying that condoms don't always protect, well something is better than nothing.
if it is a different one each week, i really doubt it. but check the signs from eye contact and flirting.
should i break up with her or continue with it, believing that she does love me?
do not ever visit areas where you used to spend time.
should i return or stay home?
do not feel upset or pained if he tries to make you feel bad. life is long.
yes, you love him, but do you want to risk him receiving a sexually transmitted disease and giving it to you?
most men are not ignorant, you are meeting the wrong people.
i believe that it is a myth and that you are all intercouse addicts.
it is ok, your partner does not need to know everything you think about.
was it a good dream?
it is best to move on if he just wants to be friends.
what goes around will come around.
it depends on the man.
it is easy to buy him a flower and say that you love him.
tell her good bye, life is too short to waste it with her.
you know, we do it as well.
he is about _num_-_num_ years old, and he has a crush on me.
if you decide to date her, have some fun!
there is not much you can do if a guy does not want a realtionship.
do the things that make you happy.
it might depend on the girl. i lie a lot, and people believe me.
the best town in your imagination. you will get what you want.
it is not good to date them all.
have you ever heard of a pajama party?
men like it when women know how to spell, or at the very least, are not so lazy that they have to look words up.
if you're not sure why, then you probably should not answer.
i've been to that place. it impressed me.
as for the man, well, simply attempt to ignore him and eventually this issue will pass.
in response to your query: no, there's no way to understand men.
i'd like to meet some friends in amsterdam.
she acts like the does not like me. should i leave her alone?
take it slow. no person likes to hear that they are a bad kisser.
not everyone is a bad person.
do you have schizoprenia?
do you like someone asking you for a date?
so something crazy - cover yourself in whipped cream or something tasty!
don't simply stand around waiting for a good thing.
what do you do if he's appealingly attractive?
you could threaten to inform the authorities if he refuses to pay your child support.
even if they continue to laugh.
i am unaware of what my next action should be.
for him just to openly express that, says a lot about his character.
say, "is it because you like someone else?"
they are hard-headed and mean, and they are going to have to learn those lessons the hard way.
it will give you quick access i guess.
he has got way too many girlfriends, help me i am confused!
i would say i agree on being a virgin, it is a serious sin not to be.
can you stop trying to control her life?
why would a guy want to go out with someone so cold?
i want to avoid fights. she gets jealous easily.
some men are scared of marraige. a good talk might help.
would you, or would you not date a virgin?
they think that their head hurts, but they have no brain - boys will be boys.
why do so many men want to live with asian women?
i suppose that it really just depends on whether you want emotional attachment.
i recommend that you close your eyes and make the right decision.
someone who is unfaithful once will be unfaithful again.
speak with me; you cannot be so lonely.
anger can be a defense mechanism.
because in all honesty that is very attractive in itself.
becoming involved with someone who is more in tune with your maturity level.
first and foremost, i would not have been attracted to her.
it is healthy and natural, take care not to get some nasty viruses.
take a good look in the mirror.
he is done with you because he got what he wanted.
as you probably already know, most men are concupiscent all the time..
i would also question how good of a friend your best friend is.
if you are considering getting back together with him, then do not.
send him a message from your cellular phone.
god makes many different moves.
when you are at least sixteen years old.
he loves you because you are his alone.
i had the same problem. look at the answers i received.
and your time and your life.
he will understand and think nothing of it.
i hope that helps even a little.
remember this caveat: the leading cause of divorce is getting married!
if he will not perform oral sex, then don't let him have sexual intercourse with you.
i hope that you will not have any problems finding someone to have sexual intercourse with.
yes, i did, and it was awful!
you can not force yourself on anyone, or you will be alone.
if you are not growing and having fun, the relationship is over.
if you are nice, i am sure she will not notice.
find her something with meaning.
it depends upon your age.
you will feel younger if you have young friends.
tell her that you abhor her and that she needs to leave you alone.
i don not think that the husband deserved to have it.
you get what you pay for.
it happens a lot to me.
no, i am a girl. i only think about sex if i am in love with a man.
if he is cheating, then break up with him.
you should think about the fact he may bring std's home to you if he is a cheater.
no, there is no way for women to ever understand men.
party while you are young.
i heard you are getting married and would like to know if you have set the date.
i find that honesty is effective for me, and you should consider it.
where he asked you out is his decision, and you made a mistake.
i am attracted to italian women.
i am trying to solve that problem myself.
if you do not find her attractive, then yes, you should not be intimate with her.
why? there are more exciting sports than that with plenty of contact?
once you have moved on, then you will not care if he moves on or not.
first of all, that is not typical for a man.
many women talk about it. people host novelty parties with sex toys.
that did not end too well.
think about it before in order to not get tongue tied.
do it when you are married.
shame on you if she does it again.
this started three months ago with flirting.
socialize with your companions from younger days in order to become acquainted with alternative unmet companions.
he will unintentionally collide with you in public locations.
in the event she's romantically inclined, obtain a bouquet and candies, despite the conclusion of valentine's day.
i'm uncertain of your feelings, however, i'm not fond of the ne'er-do-well personality.
(performed in as off-key a manner as is conceivable) inane tunes are the course of action to take!
you could attempt to create a realtionship between him and a friend.
i married a person that i met at a strip club.
i may want it more than men.
they have younger brains than we do.
his brother introduced us.
you should think this through carefully.
yes, there are. however, i am not one of them.
hello. what is your name? mine is shaba. i hope to find a friend in amsterdam. please email me.
i am not a prude in the least, but, i love oral sex, watching porno videos, and i am good looking.
most of the time, guys do not understand women, it is a scientific mystery!
your best friend is not a friend to you at all if he had intercourse with your girlfriend.
i honestly do not know, maybe i was just not born to be a good liar.
just ask, all she could say is no, but, you will never know unless you do.
i think about intercourse even more often than do my male friends.
it's sad, and it feels bad.
it's sad how people behave.
i suggest you listen to the song "baby, baby, stay gone" by jimmy wayne.
i do not even converse with other men.
if that does not work, i do not have any other advice for you, but it sometimes works for me.
if she already has a boyfriend, then you need to find someone else.
it is simple, you just have to back up everything that you say to her.
it doesn't fit in my mouth.
ask if he likes your kids, and if he doesn't think about the relationship again.
you can tell by the way they look at you if they want to talk to you.
i have been to some.
not all women, but some do.
i would stop calling, and see if he misses you and calls you.
your future is not bright, it will lead you to death.
what are the indications that a man is flirting?
why should you kill that innocent baby?
i do not know.
mine is _num_ to _num_ inches.
bill gates used to be concidered ugly, and look at him now.
he does not like kids.
always put your best friend first before girls.
he will find a girl who loves and cares about him.
he is just talking, do not run.
maybe you will find out he is a cool guy and want to stay friends.
he will not help if he says no.
let me know if you find out.
i am only trying to be fair.
she was cheating on you with another man before you both broke up.
i invited her over, we went inside my room, i shut the door.
there's a very attractive man in my neighborhood.
i'm a gemini. honestly, i don't believe in horoscopes.
it is the only thing that very serious women are serious about.
instead of a female, you should find a male you like.
however, i do enjoy making out and even a little caressing.
i do not think too much about it.
do not say too much, simply say hi.
hold your head up and smile.
my only advice is to not look back.
is it alright for me to have intercourse with my girlfriend?
if you have a child, then the child has a father.
i visited night clubs merely to have an entertaining night.
so, you believe that they will not cheat.
would you engage in intercourse with multiple people
personally, i do not think that this is useful.
what should a person do who is interested in a woman who may or may not also be interested?
what should you do if your boyfriend does not call or message you for three weeks?
you are probably too young and immature to get married if you have to ask.
nearly all ment are like that.
do not look too hard.
it does not mean good things for you in reference of dating her.
my male friends say confidence is attractive.
perhaps you could call her or work hard and earn enough money for a car.
sleep with his brother or best friend.
you could spread rumors about her.
do not send an instant message that says "asl."
i am telling you this from my personal experience.
women do talk about it often!
she did it one time so shame on her.
it can even help with your relationship.
tell the truth and deal with the consequences.
i saw them last year and they were great!
are you sure you want to be with someone unsure of what he wants?
let her try a sports bra.
tell her you love her, and try to earn money.
you all know you had the same thoughts.
i don't know you well enough to be in love with you.
stop having sexual relations with him, which you should not be having as it is.
you get bored easily when with him or her.
you know your man; if you trust him, don't worry.
you know what you should do.
ask him about it; if he denies it and you know he is being unfaithful, leave him.
if they make you happy, you fine with no flirting.
it may sound wonderful, but don't do anything for valentine's day!
men of a certain nature love to listen to them.
when he did call, it was only once a week.
most men aren't complete dolts, you just associate with them.
i would say it is not okay. just because he is a man does not mean that it is right.
my wife said it depends on what her mood is at the time.
if you are really looking for advice, then do not do it.
firs, do not do anything that you do not want to do.
is it because he does not trust me?
you are young, you should talk to your mother about this.
sorry, it will always be slightly awkward, and strange.
i just want to listen to some good love songs.
divorce is not favorable for children.
tell her there is something that you've been waiting to tell her.
i cannot believe he is telling you.
in my opinion, being someone is the best.
please help me, this is the first time that i have ever had to do anything like this for anyone.
keep it that way no matter how upset she gets.
that is not a good question. if you do not know you never will.
i do not live there so i could not tell you, sorry.
ask her why she is in a relationship as well as her feelings towards you.
i enjoy it from the back.
they enjoy it on top or bent over the way bao wow does it.
be guided according to your heart. what conveys a sense of correctness to you?
don't allow a rival female to have an opportunity with the object of your affection.
love devoid of sexual activity and sexual relations following betrothal is most ideal.
in the event i'm unable to terminate my thought patterns centering on my desired man, i merely concentrate intently on my tasks at hand or spend time reading.
it is a good question but i am a female too and we females will never know!
that has to be the worst thing you could do to your friend right now!
you do not like him but like his friend instead, so why not tell him?
i hope you get some new friends soon.
unfortunately, if you need to ask, the answer is likely yes.
do you want to get married?
sex is like air and water.
don't provide him with many opportunities.
if you are attracted to her, i suppose it is alright.
i know he loves me more now, because i was a virgin until our wedding night.
i do not agree that girls should approach first.
it depends if you are a real women or not.
the majority of guys are in relationships for their personal gain.
did this person have sex with their spouse before they were married.
is that a good question to ask a guy?
look for someone better.
give him a chance and also some time to get to know your children.
it depends, how old are you and your mother?
if you have to ask this question, i think you are probably too young to get married.
you should wait until you hear what she has to say.
go slowly and dn not just jump on him.
it appears that he has only lukewarm feelings for you.
i will tell you that if you were unfaithful to her, it does not bode well for your soul.
you must be confident, flirt somewhat, but do not be too assertive.
do not have intercourse with him and wait for his response. i hope this advice was helpful.
but i like him very much.
if you agree with him, then it is fine. what do you feel?
the most important thing is that you enjoy yourself.
however, that does not mean it is over.
i know he would not want me to either.
they do not have to be christian to cheat. women do it, also.
i am certain they believe the same things about girls.
it is nice to show someone actions or phrases to show you like a person.
if he did, he would not cheat.
we never did get together, because i was with his best friend, matt.
it will not matter is he does not know the girls.
you should be respectable about it.
he is _num_-_num_, and how old are you?
i can not believe i spent so much time with you.
i am only looking for ways to make my bedroom more exciting; what should i try?
however, that takes some time to develop.
you need to be honest with him about the telephone call.
you stated that he was in love with another woman.
i would persue a intimate relationship with her even if she had just been intimate with him.
my friends do not like him and are constantly making fun of him.
be yourself. let your personality shine. if you are fake, women can sense it.
i felt that way about a woman once. i am unable to explain why.
it looks like the guys just want one thing from you.
it is fate that does that.
my mothers friend willy lives there. you can find peopel on myspace.
you should try grabbing the first guy you see and have a one-night stand, right then and there.
a picnic lunch in a beautiful, quiet, and private setting.
you want to be careful that you do not end up at that hostel.
if it is something that you enjoy, then i do not see a problem with it.
when you want to give him a strong hug every time you see him.
everything reminds me of him and what use to be.
it is natural, why make an issue out of it?
i just broke up with my girlfriend but it is difficult to get another one. can you help me?
did he do it on purpose?
i was wondering about how to kiss her the next time.
i truly love this girl.
as long as she is not their boss.
an uncircumcied penis is not attractive.
it depends on the both of you.
if she does not care for you enough to remain with you only then it is not worth it.
i am thirteen years old and five foot ten inches tall.
i hope you have an enjoyable and interesting honeymoon.
my boyfriend takes notice of quite a few women when he is driving and he tries not to be obvious about it.
i despise that type. remember that money can purchase many things but class, style and grace are not among them.
don't take action because she will get what is hers eventually.
oh, just so you know, if the guy knew about what you said, no one would like you.
life is like that, everyone hurts each other.
i lost my virginity at the age of _num_, i honestly didn't know what was the hype all about.
just ask him if he would mind if you send picture like that.
you should take care of the problem before you try to get pregnant.
let him know you do not believe him when he says it is nothing.
you did say for better or worse, correct?
you run to him every time he says come here.
to my best friend, and your friend forever, i like cereal!
a child cannot decide if it wants to live or die.
it makes feel confident when men flirt with me, and are interested in me.
one said, "i cannot leave my kids." the other asked, "why did you ask me to have coffee with you?"
where does he work, how many hours does he work, ask those questions.
eighteen, i believe there is not need to hurry, though.
some males genuinely do not prefer any sort of contact with their derrieres.
women are a mystery, and we prefer it in that manner.
however, i genuinely adore her.
i'm not of the opinion he doesn't find you trustworthy.
i'm fond of this particular gentleman who was previously enrolled in the same course.
i just like to get some advice.
isn't it torture for one and ego for the other?
tell them you love then and see if they tell you back.
that's who we are, it's in our blood and there is nothing you can do.
i'm so loud be got complaints from out neighbors, no joke.
one day, i sat him down and i told him that i liked him.
be forward and say, "hello, are you guys going to let me in on the conversation?
he will definitely get it at some point.
if he likes you, then you should go out with him.
if i am your type and my age works for you, pick me.
dreams cannot be controlled.
have you seen the paris hilton video?
trust me, guys don't know what is best for a girl.
go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it.
she says that it doesn't mean anything and that is every guy's dream.
hang out with best buddies, take your mind off him and go have fun girl.
i can't answer that because i haven't experienced it but i think it is possible.
i believe she merely wants to come to the united states like everyone else. that is my opinion. goodbye.
he probably believes that it is a good thing.
admiration is not a good enough reason to kiss.
crying is fine, but communicating is more productive.
pregnant girls lose interest that way.
talk to the man and find out what make him act like such an imbecile.
i would probably not date an exotic dancer.
you no longer want to see his or her face.
he did not care if he knew or not.
some guy followed me in a store and acted scary.
they used to be good friends. now, they are not.
what should i do so i do not scare her away?
you are more obsessed about virginity then most guys.
you will not come across as being cheep if you do not have sex with him.
she never got over you.
why did you marry him when he is quiet and no one wants him to talk to you?
be young and enjoy yourself. do not take life overly seriously.
i am sorry to say but no, find employment.
no, if you are over forty years old then it is just as if you are eighty.
i do not enjoy hurting anyone.
no, he merely enjoys conversing with you.
your child already has a father.
i want my ex to realize that i only want to be with him.
find some work by barry white, it works.
you could find someone so natural and beautiful, but she wouldn't be very smart.
looking back, i am not really sure why i did what i did.
perhaps because you sounds so apologetic.
a good way to start would be to be honest and ask him what he thinks.
i kind of ruined jon's friendship with matt.
it probably was not the brightest thing for him to tell you, but i would not worry about it.
i like this one man names, jon, and he used to like me also.
to top it off, i did not get to climax because that headboard matter ruined the whole mood.
i would give you _num_ points for that one.
they have a lot of great suggestions.
start talking about children around your parents.
i did not. i allowed the man to approach me and ask me on a date.
i discovered that my girlfriend was actually a man.
she knows she must move forward, but she cannot. do you have any ideas that might help her?
you just answered your own question.
that is because they think they are popular and sexy and when it comes to dating they are.
most of the time i am quiet unless it is really great and then i get loud.
some snuggle and some do not.
do not be as stupid as i have been.
however, i am not the one who did anything wrong so what should i do with my love for him?
i stated that because it's correct. although it's not solitary.
jon and i used to be very close. we use to speak concerning everything.
does he state that he doesn't want to currently?
i started drinking and smoking because of it.
do not waste your time on someone who disrespects you like that.
if girls do not like you for that, it is their issue, not yours.
he can not get a girl to share.
do not go out with a stranger.
be honest with him and yourself. do you truly want him to return?
visit iraq and keep in contact.
i occasionally think only about coitus.
when a woman is interested in you, you should be able to notice. substantiate me, women.
they merely want to be loved.
a compromising position is to refuse to keep her company when she has been drinking.
he tells me that they do not mean anything to him.
move on and go have fun.
i believe you only lust for him.
additionally, inform him you had an unpleasant experience with another man who tried some things which made you upset.
in all seriousness, do not get him another dog.
for me it is a girl being mature.
was i not attractive to him that night?
break up with him and do not listen to his excuses because he does not love you.
i would work with him more.
there is more to people than what meets the eye.
it is a reflex we are prone to.
i do not care for fake breasts.
that is how life works. ups and downs are part of life and self-acceptance is necessary.
you have to take a stand.
your boyfriend is not your boyfriend.
i became interested in someone in whom i had previously not been interested when they asked me on a date, therefore you should merely ask.
can i receive custody even though he has been staying hom with the child?
men want women to behave nicely in public and promiscuously in private.
please him orally, on occasion.
perhaps you should both take s hot bath.
be nice to her, go and introduce yourself to her, and remember to smile.
are you mature enough to handle a serious relationship?
when women get together, that is mostly what all the conversations are about.
it is unlikely that you would ever be married, so you should look for someone else.
we make them uneasy and they act unintelligently.
the reason is that they usually enjoy making you feel bad.
i am of the view that they are more romantic.
you are too young and many things can go wrong.
be patient because there is a reason why this happened, and every cloud has a silver lining.
remember that because a man knows you are involved does not mean he will not try anyway.
i would not lose five seconds on a girl that is attractive and unintelligent.
it is beneficial to not have sex.
could a man be too tired for sex?
you are not old and you just need to do things you like to do.
well, if you want to meet some attractive latina females, maybe go to the library or a walmart.
in the meantime, keep flirting, care for him, and better yet get to know him.
do not let him see you when you are depressed.
as a male friend, he may show feelings towards you.
believe me, i am a guy.
decline his proposal and if he continues that, leave him.
which do you prefer? circumcised or foreskin?
she told me she did not want to be my friend over email.
how do i get out of it?
that will make you the girl of my dreams.
we want to get to know eachother better.
try and stay positive. you will find your true love soemday.
once a cheater always a cheater!
every man is different because we fall for women of all shapes and sizes.
tell him everything that you know.
pretend to be a young woman in search of a casual relationship and send him an instant message.
he thought i enjoyed myself.
she tells me that she truly loves me.
i would also be interested in participating.
only if you are best friends.
he doesn't love you, want to know how i know?
you're charming smiles doesn't cost a single cent.
don't care about them, and leave them be because you won't be fulfilled knowing those people.
you should love the person you are having sexual relations with.
i confront him when he looks at another woman, but he denies it.
don't let someone consume you.
why not just vex every man?
it means that you have a new little sister!
i am _num_ years old and i waited until marriage to have sex.
yes it is okay, everyone is attracted to other people.
do guys even think that is cute or sexy?
if a man cheats on you, he is the wrong man for you.
so, you say that you are attracted to a lesbian but you are not a lesbian yourself. that does not make any sense.
and after all that, now he is ignoring me again.
buy her a bouquet of roses for valentine's day and ask her out on a date.
send me an instant message on yahoo! messenger right now. my id is :pao__num_
go away. i need two points. i make no apologies for being rude and disrespectful to you.
i've got this friend and she's going gaga over this guy who doesn't like her back.
you don't want to lose him as a friend.
get some cool electronics out of the deal.
start showing him more love and attention.
may god and your fellow soldiers preserve you.
you are not asking anything.
mosy guys would liek a chance if you are not married.
do not tell anyone.
if you are horny, you should have sex.
you are a better person then when you met her.
i have only had sex while watching television once.
you can not get married in jail.
just email him your question.
they are bad guys who can not get a date.
look around, everyone around you is beautiful.
see how it goes from there.
if you are surfing the internet, use yahoo answers.
i do not know, but i do know that i just gained two points.
you should not see him anymore. just because you love him does not mean he loves you.
i believe pain is pleasure, and when one bleeds, it is like an orgasm.
no, however, that is because men have different hormones than women do.
it is true. that is how i get, sometimes.
i would not take it that seriously. it is only a dream.
it means you can have your cake and eat it, too.
it is time to move on, it may hurt but that is life.
don't hurt him, but protect yourself as well.
it is the way life goes.
i do not mean "flirting" as in pretending not to know.
when my girlfriend bit off my genitalis and ate it.
when you have sex feelings get involved.
so theres a lot more out there.
you can hold a _num_ hour conversation.
marriage is not a joke.
if you are interested in him, then go on a date with him. why do you need to ask on here?
i never thought i would get asked on a date but i did.
if i am interested in a man, then i ask him on a date before another woman does.
there is no way i would post personal information like that.
that sounds like a break up.
my boyfriend of over a year has continued to lie to me.
it is the same reason as mine.
love does not mean money, do not judge it by money.
she will always be there for you, and care about you.
i fell to my knees. i will never forget that moment.
however, she does not trust me due to the fact that i have expressed similar sentiments to both of them.
i can guarantee that all young women who believe they think about intercourse frequently are mistaken.
simply be original. that is all you have to do.
if you are in a relationship with one, then you should consider whether or not she is worth the pain.
you should get a job, then you will have your own money.
the reason is because they are in love and believe that there is hope.
that is a tough call so i would recommend that you date her friend to make her jealous.
i wonder whether sex is so good that some people are willing to risk so much.
the best revenge is to move forward with your life and forget that the unfaithful person ever existed.
it is like you are happy most of the time. you are always glowing.
be careful what you do if he is a misunderstood human.
because mine and all the other men's trains of thought ran off the tracks.
you cannot and i would be disrespectful to the minister.
if it hurts and the woman cannot take it, then it may be too long.
it's time to move on.
do you have a cast iron skillet?
any man can be a coward to responsibility.
that was unfortunate. in the future, at no time will the television be powered simultaneously as sexual intercourse occurs.
inform her that were she to feel romantically towards you, she would visit and engage in wild sexual intercourse and ingest your ejaculate.
if you're unable to tolerate a friendship with him, then allow him his solitude.
you experience the most incredible sensation you've experienced so far in your entire existence.
however, exclusively on occasions when they're sexually inclined or if you add spice to the occasion.
what does it stand for?
if you do and it is about love, then it is probably good.
it all depends on the guy, not all guys.
yes it is but are you in love?
red is a bloody color, but we associate blue with love.
they all feel you are a jerk.
they must accept it.
especially if you are used to regularly having intercourse.
or perhaps someone is trying to separate the two of you.
having intercourse with a man whose genitalia was too small.
what is shameful about it? coitus is very good.
stop thinking about him.
want to see me change my teeth?
don't spend too much money.
i would not dump my girlfriend over those i have received nude photos from.
just look into her eyes and smile.
it could not have been so bad if they got married anyway.
it could be a friend, a spouse, or even a family member.
you should leave him because you can do bad things all by yourself.
to secure the individual to commit with you is difficult.
if you're in bangalore, i am here.
he's untruthful, and disconnects the phone when i'm speaking.
i don't believe it's a sin, although it terminates in fornication.
to be on the shore, next to a bonfire, with _num_ sounds fantastic!
you are going to find someone that will make you forget about him.
do you believe in books about what dreams mean?
i think it takes a lot of patience.
what should i say?
however, we are happy and enjoy life!
you only marry if you want to spend the rest of your life with this man!
he always says he is sorry, but then in a month he is lying and being dishonest.
i start quietand then get louder and louder and then there is an explosion!
i cannot help wondering if it was me.
not all men have sexual relations as their main focus.
most likely his concept of a good time is some sort of sexual relationship.
if you are attracted to a man, then converse with him and begin a relationship.
it would depend mostly on how attractive she is.
so, make sure she is aware of how much you care about her.
do not tell him face to face; it may have been good at one time but it will not be now.
recognize what you do not want to.
trust me, it can become unpleasant.
men are not scared of the word "love."
no; perhaps he wants to hear your voice before he goes to bed.
would you make out with him, even if you were not officially a couple?
you are wrong on the personal issues.
it is when you cannot get that person off of your mind.
i would ask her if she was yours.
how anyone not like children?
the first woman i met, i wanted to marry her right then, i remember it like it was yesterday.
i asked him, "how do you know that i am looking at you?!"
and then, their friends will talk about you with disdain to theirs, and so on and so on.
i am asking because, it is like there are always guys that are up for having sex.
do notmlet anyone tell you anything different.
jealousy is a hard thing to fight.
you should dress and act, ladylike.
as soon as they get made because you will not have sex with them, leave them.
if that doesn't work, then i don't have any other answers.
i don't like the language they are using.
that person is now a dear friend.
your age difference is rather drastic, so you should be careful.
it continues with window dressing.
inform her of your feelings, why you have these emotions.
he will not be married for much longer.
i meant to say that beauty is skin deep.
you are not considerate unless to return the favor.
she was an outcast, punk rock girl with large blue eyes.
it is not better to just send money; your child wants you to be there.
how is discrimination based on sexual orientation wrong?
i prefer hispanic men above all others.
if i do, then why would i be going through all of his things?
no love, but, who would know right?
but, try to force her to, because not wearing a bra is very unattractive.
it was probably the flirting led you to believe he did want more?
if that does not work, tell him that you have a sexually transmitted disease.
she simply is my true love even if she is not considered special by others.
go to places where there are black men.
i disagree: you must act intelligently.
if you are referring to the intenet, that is the wrong place.
i have heard that a lot of guys prefer virgins.
i like a girl with small breasts and a cute behind.
they are addicted to orgasms.
if the guy does not like her, then she should move on.
it seems obvious that you have decided not to sleep with him or you would have done so by now.
if that is the case, then for how many years have you been married?
say yes if you are interested in him and no if you are not.
trust your humor, attractiveness, intelligence, relations with others, etc.
you are taking the right course of action. divorce him and continue with your life.
stop dreaming and thinking of what could be.
if he loves you, then he would not care that you have nothing to offer.
a few places to go are beaches, restaurants, etc.
yes, tell him. the worst he will do is reject you.
simply be friends with him.
i caught him cheating later.
try to kiss him to see if you have any feelings for him?
you will have more temptations rather than being in love.
don't play games, you won't be successful.
i will still be eating my chocolates and enjoying my roses while you?
just remember a man is still a man.
so do you want to have sex or not?
first of all, you can't help what you dream about and second, fantasizing is just a fantasy.
if my sister's friend mess up with me, i would leave the room immediately.
i would expect her to do the same thing; your solution is to find a better guy.
stick it out if he understands.
she only dreams about him.
don't compromise for anyone.
i like thugish type of guys.
i was _num_ when i was with her.
do you think she knows that you like her?
don't tell her you love her to early.
they will never be you.
i care for him a lot, and i also miss him.
you broke up, leave the rest to him.
i noticed that you like the goo goo dolls, have you seen them in concert?
maybe she is not a materialistic kind of girl.
there is really no way to answer that without sounding like a racist, which i am not.
basically, it is deciding who i want to marry.
simply remember that it is up to you; if you do not want to, you do not have to.
later that month, things began to change.
truly tell her to consider carefully.
how about na nice homemade personized gift, it always hits straight to the heart!
then, it is up to her or not to listen, and to find out the hard way, or the easy way.
they are not the kind men that you want in your life.
have you ever had an arguement like that?
you do not even know how old he is?
forgive and forget as little as possible.
he is about three to five year older, so he is very mature.
you can at least trust us, because even if we lied you would know!
movies are enjoyable, however, they do not provide much room for bonding.
she had attempted to use the credit cars, she learned they were not working.
i can tell that all girls think differently.
dreams are nothing until your brain works them out.
be careful you are going down a dangerous pathway.
you should hit him on the head.
pretend to like it, even though you may not.
marriage is better, but no one said that is was going to be easy.
if not, then someone will find you.
how old are you? well, that does not matter. run!
i am just not attracted to you anymore.
were i to do so, yahoo answers would not serve as the location for my search!
should you attempt it on a single occasion, the apparent meaning is it was attemtped on a single occasion.
in the event my husband were unfaithful, i'd most likely sever his genitals and display them upon the rear-facing mirror of my mustang vehicle.
i become hungry twice a day.
i laughed very hard when i read it.
i enjoy talking with him. i do not feel particularly well unless i talk with him.
friends are difficult to obtain.
become inebriated and kiss her. that is how i did it three years ago.
if the man has such an attitude of mind, then he is not worth your love, even if you are plain.
so that is why i chose matt.
my yahoo chat name used to be 'iscreamifyoudoitright'.
you need to ask her, she will probably want you to have help.
one of them will get it.
my wife kissed me, then left with the children.
you will find out quickly if you undress in front of him!
then i learned that he likes me.
i am, because if i was not, i would be with a girl.
if he has friends, however, perhaps he likes you.
why would a young man not date a virgin?
who here has married their high school sweetheart?
have you seen the movie "the game"?
leave him be, he has what he wants now and probably doesn't want to be in contact anymore.
you may be in trouble if you don't leave him be.
i've gone a few dates, without acting with a certain demeanor.
you will most likely be attracted to me when we meet.
you are, however, too good for her in any event.
if you cannot find one in a pet store, look around the barns.
just break up or she will stay to hurt you and enjoy doing it.
it is simple: simply tell him to either talk to you or get out of your life.
simply tell him you respect yourself.
it is not an ideal situation for someone who has an available sexual outlet.
well, if she will not tell you, then she doe not want you to know.
i asked him if he liked me, and he answered no.
you should look over photos of young men.
i suggest you do what feels right.
why are you unemployed?
you should behave appropriately and not take girls for granted.
you are using poor judgement, and if you were my child you would not be allowed to date.
she is using you to get over here.
you need to talk to him about it and tell him to stop.
i need to know if it is alright.
have sexual intercourse right before you go to bed.
if he talks about it, then listen and show him that you care.
it is the same reason why men do it.
you forget about it, move on to new things, and find someone who loves you.
a boyfriend who is also his friend.
read my questions and answers section. i was in a relationship with a friend of my new girlfriend and i broke up with her.
if he is handsome and nice, then say yes.
if he likes you, tell him you love him. it will move the relationship forward and it worked for me!
if you are male, then sure!
i am afraid to ask him if he still has feelings for me, as i liked him as well.
if in doubt, ask her permission!
you do not need anyone to bring you down.
i could not hurt someone i care about.
did you cheat on her?
i do not like women like that.
you can follow someone around if you want.
all the clues from the secret admirer led up to you.
i repeat, this is something that you want to tell him face to face.
no, not at all, you will have to get to know her.
love always finds it's way, if you guys really do love each other, if it is really meant to be.
this is how problems come about in america!
the options are to co-exist peacefully with the individual or to not do so.
i have no certainty, prepare his dinner meal, demonstrate your empathy.
we believe we are transmitting explanatory information to that group, however, they fail to receive it.
despite that fact that i'm positive if they were able to, we are unanimously aware how the determination would take place.
perhaps you'd best feel no concern whatsoever.
first, kiss her on the cheek. if she know what you mean, then she will carry on from there.
my husband and i moved in two weeks ago. you should go for it.
it is not about the size, it is how you use it.
i think that everyone has a right to enjoy my girlfriend's exotic dancing. you are welcome to join the party also.
when you hear that love song and all you can do is to think about them.
but do you love somebody?
but even so, she is still your friend.
i know much. send me an e-mail and i will tell you.
do not try to impress her. simply tell her that you like her.
do you have irish ancestors?
perhaps that is why they are called fantasies.
some learn and do it well, while others do not.
however, they need not be partially unclothed.
if you find the answer, let me know?
i want to do things to you. things i would not even do to an oreo cookie.
i am mature, so do not mess with me.
do not go to him and say, hey, i want to have sex with your sister.
until that time comes, quit being so stubborn.
if you really like him, you will just feel it.
not at all a bad person.
it doesn't matter, as long as you do it correctly.
be nice, relax, and let her know that you like her.
people do not do things that they do not benefit from.
i believe a woman should make her own decisions.
you should call and ask him.
i am a _num_ year-old female.
people have many reasons as to why they have not found the right person to date.
the two of you can still be friends, even friends with benefits.
do you really want him to ask you to marry him?
forget it and go out with me!
just do it, if you wait you will never get anywhere.
look, you just have to be normal.
every once in a while i won't, just for a change.
begin looking for someone more compatible and closer to your age.
have i told you lately that i love you?
it can mean many different things.
i say, "look at what you are wearing."
what do you do when you like a guy who likes you back?
you are not getting any, my friend.
you should really focus on getting to level three.
she should decide to use birth control.
i do not think about sex as much as my ex did.
i do not like super sensitive people though!
why would you want to marry someone who is in jail?
we have flirted a lot, but i am still unsure.
it is not men, it is the boy you went on a date with.
i took an instant dislike for him
then of course there are many questions about what kind of sex i have had.
just speak with your eyes, baby.
women want it done slowly, and men want it done without teasing.
we sat on my bed and i looked into her eyes and we hugged and kissed and made out.
you do not have to get married, as you could just become someone's partner.
you must accept the truth, even though it is sad.
do you love your former girlfriend at all?
your options are to get over him or to wait.
now, most people have had past sexual experiences.
repeat after me, "you are lying."
i was just wondering and thank you for answering.
go hang around some really rough men, you know what i mean, "a man's man."
i care for him as a very good friend.
i am a self-proclaimed nymphomaniac, however i am not sure if i'm really nasty or really aroused all the time.
she might be honest with you and let you know that she really does not want to be with you anymore.
young lady, it is alright if you do not want to have sex with a man.
first, who ended the realtionship?
if you dress appropriately, you will attract nicer men.
i will try anything once, and i will do it again if i enjoy it.
as long as there is no physical activity, i do not see why not.
i do not know. are you prepared for one?
jon told me that i should stay with matt.
he will be pleasantly surprised and love you even more for it.
you should never cheat on her with her friend and then treat her friend better then you treated her.
if you are not going to marry him, do not stay together.
the girls that smell do not realize that they do.
it depends on the guy if he cares about that sort of thing.
tell him to go to hades!
you need to have more confidence in your self and break up with your boyfriend.
it is because women do not like spineless men.
yes, men do think about sex more than women do.
maybe you are making a mistake?
just because he is older, doesn't mean he is out of touch.
is there a reason why you don't trust him?
hand him a toilet brush.
send me an e-mail if you want more. my e-mail address is digital_lyricist@yahoo.com.
if you want to get married, then do so.
men are beautiful regardless of their appearance or deeds.
ask him boldly if he wants to elope.
too much of a good experience can become burdensome.
they have one single thought.
he doesn't like your children, and you do not like his?
enjoy your life now when you're single.
it is called lust, and lust is a sin.
i guess i have some slight anxiety about the situation.
my new girlfriend is very special to me.
make sure you're having a decent, clean time.
you get two of everything.
there is a perfect match for every woman.
go sight seeing or to the movies.
you should be angry about this.
she might want to have intercourse with someone other than you.
where do you find these statistics?
if you have a connection with someone, don't worry about the feelings of others.
i love having phone sex with my boyfriend.
tell him to his face, in a nice way, that the relationship is over.
it's simple, find someone in the jail who can marry you.
some guy might ask why women are very promiscuious.
she might do it again. i will let him know.
do not let anyone tell you that you are different.
if they guy is going to marry the girl, she should not have slept with many guys.
i am an old fashioned kind of guy.
should you be in the company of someone unsaved (a sinner), you are a sinner, as well.
no physical interaction, no eye contact, no touching hands, merely the belief that the cohort offers the actual explanation.
perhaps she possesses the similar emotions that you possess.
excellent appearance, refined tendencies, and, without a doubt, an excellent physique constitutes a desirable female companion.
why not get a job, and then send him the money?
give her something really nice, and then right on the spot, ask her.
then, she would think you wee really hiding something.
stop dwelling on appearances, and start examining how people treat you.
can anyone here speak english clearly?
it is about the one with whom you are.
who could deny that?
repeat after me: "it is not my fault!"
i have two. you must judge for yourself.
she questioned my emotions.
my old man does not. he simply gets right to it, and dives in.
one day he started flirting with me.
only if you feel like you need a boyfriend.
no, because the same thing happened to me. it may be different.
would it bother him if you were asking other men for pictures?
it is good that you are experiencing new things.
it was not meant to be.
start to do things that he would not like.
he might get scared if you talk about marraige and kids.
it is possible that the flowers might be too strong.
you may want to tell him to slow down.
when i got together with matt, i did not know jon liked me.
i will hide their lunch box and not play with them at recess.
i do not think you can spell.
you can do better, most likely.
that is none of your business.
it makes people even more anxious and jealous, so beware.
i have had this problem multiple times. stick with both but make sure to play your cards correctly.
it maybe a little too late to terminate. it might
so, i will let you know the secrets of what guys dream of.
if he had treated her better, then i do not see anything wrong with it, it is not like she is your sister.
men are so conceited man!
if she likes you, then, you can tell her that you are new at it.
it depends upon you. would you want to?
it simply bothers be because i want to with him but i also want to wait.
if you like another young man, you should most likely simply say so.
are you having trouble with the one you have?
he does not do drugs.
just be friendly, not pushy.
he probably did not answer your calls because he was truly busy.
i suggest asking them when they are taking a lie detector test.
i like him, but i am not in love with him.
i recommend going to the gym to practice speaking in a lower voice, and always be confident.
i recommend being direct with your friend.
you can do better.
tell him your child is in need of his father.
i am _num_ years old, but i feel old.
do not let sex ruin anything.
why can they just not treat us with respect?
if he is still speaking with her, he is most likely being unfaithful to you or coming close to it.
however, once she leaves, karma will come back to him.
i would say, in most cases, yes.
women are not just ready. you need to help.
do not ask, let him say it on his own.
out of men i would have to choose black ones; white men just do not satisfy me
if you already free him in your life, and find another girl.
well, now i'm pregnant with his kid, how do i tell him without him going ballistic?
do not make it last too long. make it short and get to the point quickly.
would you appreciate being called unintelligent?
i do not know, because my fiance and i are that way as well.
my guy does that because he says it gives him an opportunity to tell me how beautiful i am.
i also enjoy children, but i'm not one myself.
it's not something that males like to do.
i would not necessarily cut off a friendship just because we had a fight.
do you envision yourself being happy with this person for the rest of your life?
think about why you broke up then move on.
go where your urine leads you, which may be the wrong direction.
i need advice from other people.
break up with the girlfriend you have. she would be shocked.
a personality that is not too bad.
i do not believe that girls are bad at lying.
personally, i find it creepy, although some people do find it intensely pleasurable, which i do not understand.
it is a normal process to take a step back and re-evaluate something.
you need to decide if you like him or not.
in my opinion, he does not sound like a good mate.
if you are attracted to boy boys and girls, then you are bi-sexual.
he should be kind enough not to break someone's heart.
first, choose the guy that you love.
men are people and have feelings just like us women do.
i can not think of any reasons.
i would not want my boyfriend having lunch with another woman on valentines day!
many reasons for divorces are: money, kids, infidelity, stress and family.
for older kids try putt putt golf, laser tag, go karts, or anything of that sort.
i loved my boyfriend of eight years.
i am very mature for my age as well.
when you find your gem, hopefully he will want you for you.
she is the empoloyer, and you had an intimate interlude with her; that is all.
the problem with this is, how can i decline and still remain friends?
you will regret it, if you don't confront him.
take is slow and steady.
tell them at the right moment, not when you're surrounded by other people.
good things come to those who wait.
show her that she is important and not your friends.
no, it is not always about physical appearance.
he is as clueless as i am.
i have been nice to her. what should i do next?
what kind of father does that make him?
if she does break your heart, it is not going to be my fault, you should not have followed my advice.
i do not know how i feel about him anymore after he embarrassed me in front of that group of people!
maybe you two need some time apart from each other.
that is a man's way of saying that he just wants to be casual.
are you just excited about being in love?
so be it if he wants to be friends.
have you wondered why they have to fight?
that is all they think about.
we are not mind readers.
men will says things like that to play with you.
it is probably because you are single and could not get a date.
if you become involved with a mess, you will find yourself embroiled in a mess.
i forgot an important one for women; have you ever used the sample cosmetics at the mall?
simply kiss him one day.
it depends upon if he likes war games, sports, role playing, etc.
all men do so, even when they are married.
i like to fantasize about many different men, it is fine.
you will never catch a woman admitting that.
if you have to ask this, it mean you love your wife.
if he doesn't know who you are, it looks like it will be hard, but you should still try it.
if you brush your teeth and mouth twice, there should be no trouble.
because some boys seem to lose their ability to think when they are around a very attractive girl such as myself.
if you are too young, such as around twelve-years-old, then no.
you need to understand the persons emotions and talk with them about the emotional things.
yes the money is really good, but there is a lot of things in those places.
it depends on how it is.
you will not meet anyone serious.
i tried talking to him, but he will not return my calls.
tell them that you are sad.
i live in romania, come here with me.
you wake up one day and you just know.
they are happy, so it could work for you, too!
believe me, do not play around with a friend's younger sister.
if all you want is to be with him, then stay with him.
we should talk on yahoo. my handle is shrunkenmann_thegrass.
she looks up to you as a friend but nothing more than that.
i would not worry about being embarrassed.
if you feel the need send him one too.
you have some work to be done.
have a serious talk and tell her that she is getting older, and this behavior is childish.
you should make sure you want to communicate.
if you can't say this to his face, say it to yourself in the mirror while he is away.
as for what you should do, don't do anything.
no, only if they are ill.
and if not, then you will show him how.
i am searching for a woman who is a virgin, as i am one too.
yes, your mother is going out with him.
he will love you more.
if you think of that, it could you to heartbreak. wait and watch what happens.
he must have been a friend at one time.
i use to say "hey, i have enough friends".
she is not your best friend. you should keep your eyes on her.
i reccommend searching through yahoo personals in an attempt to find a man that you are interested in.
tell him that if he is interested you would go out with him sometime.
stare at it for a while.
she may be my mother, but that is another story!
you may be too attractive for your own good.
go on a cruise ship and push her overboard.
do not crowd her, inform her of your love.
it's not disagreeable, if you enjoy it, and it's with a responsible individual.
they don't utilize the corona on their shoulders.
self confidence, it's sexy!
i have dated multiple bisexual females. it's a huge aphrodisiac!
in the event i genuinely give it some consideration, i want a relationship with the pair of them, i imagine.
negative, it's only that he adores trading in girlfriends every once in a while.
the two of them. if i'm required to make just one selection, then an attractive appearance for the time being.
i'll venture that the your instinctual sense of what's occurring...is what's occurring.
i suppose a bit of both.
have intercourse with someone you love.
yes, as user lumbeeman said, have your best friend tell him for you.
yes he is a man. that is what we do.
every time i return, it's the same complaints again.
allow him to know the true you.
nobody comprehends what true problems are until you get married and have children.
that's untrue. if you truly are in love, your relationship will remain strong, no matter what occurs.
we meet each other often, and i believe i like him.
maybe he is checking to see if you're okay.
you will find many sweet meanings when you're in love.
of course, feel free to talk to me anytime.
you will still feel as if you cannot trust men.
don't expect to purchase an expensive gift.
believe what you want.
why would i date a woman whose a exotic dancer? because that's not important to me.
a sense of humor is important.
he respects that you want to wait, and he understands.
there was a boy who used to stare at me, i thought he liked me.
if you are ok with it, it will be ok.
jst assure her that mom/dad both love her very much, even though they do not live together any longer.
you will be a good sister.
i think that people always want what they cannot have.
you can like whoever you like.
you should tell her to wait.
you need to tell your partner and attempt to understand him. help youself by helping each other.
my husband and i was married on july _num_ of _num_ we went to hawaii for two weeks for our honeymoon.
if you are not the intercourse will be painful.
what will i do with the two of them?
do not say yes unless you totally love it!
there are men who do not pay attention to looks.
where would you like this to go?
he is not lonely.
if he still continues to act like that, you should break up.
finding love is the real reason for your success.
i am sure you will find one, if you try being the woman.
do you know what love is?
you urinate from there and do not wipe yourself clean.
any man, other than a desperate one, will not ask you on another date if you have broken up with him.
we attempt to make women feel comfortable.
or if i see you with another woman, i will tear her arms off.
you need to get a job if you are asking such questions.
is he a decent person and nice?
i have a friend who got a genital piercing.
how do i ask another woman to join is in the bedroom?
you know what to do.
n, everything that everyone else said is also true.
i do not care if you are a virgin. if you are promiscuous, then that is a problem because i do not want a venereal disease.
tell her while in the midst of a conversation in order to surprise her.
if he does, then he cares about you.
as long as you remain honest and good, love will find you.
wait until she emails you, or ask in person.
it is easier to just move on.
tell them that they will not succeed in life by lying.
dogs are like family.
if your heart desires it, but your gut says run follow your gut.
and, without a doubt, visit and offer salutations!
if they are self-injuring to such a degree that they're unable to pay attention, locate an alternative grown-up. a grandfather or grandmother perhaps?
i'm aware of a female who was wedded to an abusive lowlife and he physically abused her children.
because they're in possession of a burdened mindset.
the dog was in custody and the children were in bed after the police left.
stop doing this if she is not willing.
i would like to talk to someone.
yes, you are a complete stranger to me.
i do not think that most men are simple-minded.
if you are a woman and you are attracted to a lesbian, then you are a lesbian.
even if what he is saying is truthful, why would he text message other women, asking for nude pictures?
i love my ex with all of my heart.
do not tell him, first, go to your mother or school social worker. let them talk to your parents.
it is not very difficult if you know what you are doing.
if it is true love then he will wait for you without cheating on you.
if you can make them laugh, they will love you.
men like that are horrible!
only if you like being treated like feces.
i would not want to the seventh man if she starts to think about the eighth.
i will turn _num_ on august _num_, _num_
this is the kind of love most people seek but are too lazy to work for it.
perhaps they were concerned that if you knew, you would be angry..
simply talk to her and decide whether she likes you.
that is a great way to start the day.
he did not want a second chance.
if she wants to see you, she will when she is free.
lights on top is provocative.
be a friend and give him some time and space.
you are starting to hate the male/female friends of the one you love.
do something that most people have not.
i do not believe that love dies so quickly.
i think it is nothing.
she is probably living with her parents.
this is a no.
she is still with you so obviously she does.
i would not worry about such things.
it sounds as though he is pretending not to be interested and you are not.
i do not think that the chickens care.
you will get out only what you put in.
if you smell, you should use soap.
move on with your life. consider how lucky you are to not be with him.
what can i do to convince her to lose weight?
leave him. he is not worth your time.
a lot of attention and to be fed chocolate.
if he becomes possessive, it is time to leave him.
when you can hear each other without speaking.
you should try it soon, you won't be disappointed.
i mean, how insensitive of her to behave that way in front of you.
go to a party, and strike a conversation with the party goers.
ask him. it may be awkward, but it will be worth it if he does love you.
say that you love them. if it is meant to be, then the words will simply come out of your mouth.
it will eventually be worth the trouble.
i am always interested in rude men. what is my problem?
should i pack my husband's suitcase?
this means that you don't have a relationship.
why does my ex partner try to make me jealous?
my best friend is a man, and we have never been involved.
in my case, it didn't work out.
spend time with her and go shipping with her if she enjoys it.
no, he already has a girlfriend, regrettably.
if you love a boy then you should tell him.
my father is that way as well.
he needs to grow older and mature.
i am not asking him on a date or anything similar.
first of all, men say things which they do not mean.
find another woman; she does not love you.
marrying the woman i love would mean that i have everything i want.
and start to know her better.
i am married and have a child. i want to be single again.
obtain a new boyfriend if you care that much.
you deserve someone who will not take advice from others before asking you.
of course, if you are over the age of eighteen.
he said, " hey baby, what is going on?"
and you both have already had sexual intercourse?
well, you can apologize, but, you will not get him back, you made your decision, so you have to live with it.
how about trying to watch an adult movie together?
inquire as to why she doesn't like you.
she has a boyfriend, so you shouldn't try to go out with her.
yes, it could work out if you want it to.
it is too late, you've lost your chance with her.
when you love each other, you will have intercourse.
because after all, i am in your school.
come on ladies, tell him!
just be patient with yourself and do not rush.
i heard once that it was not.
be sure to stay away from the plants that i mentioned.
people are rather unintelligent.
it could never be boring.
i have been in a relationship with my husband since i was nineteen years old. i will be twenty-six years old next month.
never buy lingerie for a woman unless it is something she wants.
i feel the same, but i do not think it is a bad choice.
we are now friends after i asked her to dance.
you need to accept him for who he is.
if he does not respect you, you should break up.
my friends can never find a friend like me.
show him what you like, instead of telling him.
you do not find her, it just happens.
do you understand that they are only using you?
because you are not even sure, you you that it is not worth it.
i would marry your cat just to be able to become a part of the family.
before long, you have made them fall in love with you.
i am here, dear, all you have to do is ask.
you should let loose a bit, anywhere and everywhere.
good luck, friend, you will need it.
it is not morally right, and is it legal?
my sister has since broken up with him, but she is pregnant with his child.
yes, a woman knows what a woman wants, correct?
he even had intercourse with the wife of his best friend.
or do you enjoy hurting those that mean so much to you.
it is pretty much up to you to decide you do not want to be miserable anymore.
i would not want or need anyone else.
something that happened behind your back.
become a friend to a women first.
he probably will not tell you but he will most likely tell someone else.
when you are in a relationship and you go out just for fun, that kills your partner.
he is a total jerk and i never want to see him again.
she might be faking the moaning, shaking, and thrashing around but she cannot fake that.
you may have and just don't know it yet.
don't push yourself over the edge with planning.
we get along well, except for this problem.
is it time for new living conditions?
ask him or your friends that know him well, they may have an answer.
tell him that he is an attractive vampire.
the coaches were more laid back and i usually played over half the game.
they left us no choice but the part, i never stopped loving him.
start by saying "i want to kiss your nose, then your mouth and your cheek, then your neck.
girl, don't tell him you want to make love to him.
i don't know, are you in love?
it will be well worth the wait.
i don't believe you should give him anymore chances.
he will find another, but you seem to want something more.
convince them to break out with you.
if he is in love with you, he will be heartbroken, but eventually get over it.
you should not be with a man who continues to pressure you to do things you do not want to do.
some men with experience do not know what they are doing.
have intercourse with people who are good at mathematics. they know how to handle curves.
you basically have to overdose in order to feel anything.
if you have tried too hard.
i am curious now, too, so what was that about?
i would say an upscale strip bar with lots of beer.
yes, i would, in a heartbeat.
here is not where you will find one.
yes, if you are willing to get up off that chair!
that also, depends on who you are.
yes, at least mime lived.
because if you never give it a chance, then you will never know, what would have happened between the two of you.
i have never heard of a man who did not like this.
obviously, if he is going through all that trouble to scare you, then he does not want you.
things like this are awful to do through email.
why did you post such a stereotypical, daft and pointless question?
i want her to open her eyes before something bad happens.
that is very unfair to the guy you are dating.
women want a man to be himself.
it is too strange.
this is a tough situation. good luck.
it is not bad, if you like him.
he could be simply using you for coitus.
i am sorry if you love him, though you said you did not. anyway, please leave him.
you have the right to be mad.
send him a post card from bora bora.
you should tell her and see what response you receive.
you shold not care as long as you were right. is that correct?
i agree with you,
they have a hard face.
she does not answer me when i ask her to be my girlfriend.
there are better things you an do with your life then try to understand men.
yes i care, but it is not everything.
hello, i am twelve and have my first girlfriend.
ask him if he loves you, then tell him that you love him, and ask him to be your boyfriend.
this is not bad at all.
you both already know so much about one another.
i do not talk badly about people.
ok, ask me one question at a time, you are confusing me.
choose a hooker to cheat with, they have the most experience.
women can also have them.
do not use sex as a weapon in your marriage.
you get to sample other women without cheating.
what happened to his queen kong?
maybe, but i will never find him.
do not do that in private.
it does not matter what gender they are.
mind your personal hygiene.
you can be in a skirt or a pair of loose jeans.
do not act gross.
he used to abuse me mentally and physically.
i have gone out with large guys.
do you have a unattractive butt?
if you like her, ask her out.
let him know that you do not like that guy.
i just want to be friends with women, said no guy ever!
what are your thoughts on marriage?
yes, i will not be in a relationship with a large man.
attempt to stay out of it until time makes them calm.
where can i find you?
it is better to loose a lover than to love a looser.
if a man does that to me, i move on.
the way it has worked for me is to go out with a friend.
do not do anything you do not want to.
gab said there is no way to know.
you are a forty year old woman and should look for someone around your age.
do not push women because they do not respond well.
why don't you call and send her a valentine's day card?
you may lose the one you love to another person.
my best friend went out with a shorter man, they even kissed each other.
i am _num_, why would anyone lie about their age?
what exactly does a guy want from a girl?
i asked my ex that question last night when we talked.
if he is nice and likes you, he will understand and will probably stop.
and for another thing, be sure to trust her.
just surprise him, you can do it.
just wait, maybe it's not the time for you to meet the right one.
no it's not normal, it is abnormal
i'm confused, what were your asking?
if he did, then he would not have even looked at the other woman.
if i could rearrange the alphabet, then i would place "u" beside "i."
i cannot even consider going on a date with someone with whom i previously broke up.
why do married or committed men cheat?
after all, she has lived every day just for you.
where in the world do you live?
it seems from your statement that you are merely hoping extravagantly, dr. checko.
who can piece me back together?
you ought to ask a person that you trust or a doctor.
any person who adores you should think about your feelings.
in where does the infant's father fit?
you should not have intercourse with your cousin.
my love, my girlfriend, my everything, a perfect woman.
men can have female friends as well.
you may discover that you do not enjoy sexual activities with women at all.
i think stupid is better then dumb.
the chase is over once they are interested.
why would you date someone with that laege of an age gap?
some guys have nice looking backsides.
you need to break up if he is trying to control you.
if you really like this person, then why not give it a try?
no, it was the drop dead girl who broke up with me, and i wont care about her anymore.
there is no doubt about it that i am correct.
i think you dont have an answer, and you do not want to admit it.
there is nothing to worry about, love conquers all.
it will be tough if you are a teen or child.
at midnight, go to wendy's after picking them up from the nursing home.
i love my child's father to death.
remember that this man had not been in a relationship for almost nine years.
read this article and say whatever you can in order to stop her.
instead say, "who is on your mind?"
many men are happy. keep intercourse interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it.
just sit them down and explain to them- they should be understanding and support you no matter what.
i am just his friend. i love him and as far as i know he does not know that.
you have a problem with us?
if you do not see any results after three weeks.
i have it on my camera.
the guy is married.
it's usually the one who is not good in bed.
it is never boring and is actually fulfilling.
turn the lights off and use a few candles and lie on top of the covers.
yes, you can; i wonder where you were that day in sex education class.
take it, but do not take it for granted.
if they do not, then they are not worth you caring what they think.
why would he ignore me?
i like a guy with a round behind.
there is no tension between me and my guy friends, who are like brothers to me.
a coat hanger and a vacum will help.
try having a nice impression on her.
have a party with all your girlfriends and let her mingle with new faces.
the way you are spelling tells me how worried you are.
it sounds like you are attractive; so, i think we are off to a good start.
you are the best at it.
you are such a green-minded person.
most married men are happy.
do not ask if they are a virgin.
i understand as i have the same problem.
i apologize to the girls for what the rude person said about all of you; the rest of us think that you are all great.
do not worry about what anyone else may think.
what is it that you would like to do now?
you have to really learn how to read a person, do you understand what i mean?
man: "i am a caveman." woman: "what is this?"
yes, give the cat away.
get it over with and send him a text message.
or me male ego cannot deal with a woman knowing about it.
if you have money to spend, most women love jewelry.
if she likes to go to the beach, perhaps a weekend in the bahamas.
i am just stating my opinion!
if no one that you like asks you for a date, then just refuse.
it can be very sensuous to watch a woman and you might learn something new.
say it in person, set up some sort of dinner date.
if you don't take any precautions, you could become pregnant.
he is ignoring you for the same reasons we ignore you.
when i went there, i noticed that as well.
i am _num_ years old, and almost handsome.
tell her to ask him on a date.
your question allows people to know that you are single.
friends before significant others. the saying is meaningful regardless of gender.
i would not die for a stranger or a friend.
people do not care anymore about others.
you tell him it is your way or no way.
call and say hello and be done with it one way or another.
put your nose into her!
she does not like you romantically.
i am in a long distance relationship.
what are you doing?
do not allow her to confuse you.
it cannot be love because you know nothing about her.
it is better and simpler to say over th phone or in person.
you will not discover love on the internet.
you cannot base your life on her.
it is clear that you should take her on a date.
tell them you already have a date and apologize. say they should have asked earlier.
simple. two points for each of us.
i once just said, "if there is nothing better to do . . ."
she may have an underlying factor that causes her to eat this much.
step three: if she is pregnant, then end the procedure.
you are sly. i was going to ask this question.
it is probably the one thing that is more important than good health for humans.
a woman likes to be treated like a queen and pampered.
rmantic love is very fun.
what do you think?
it is your personal choice.
can you check it out for me?
how can you get the man you are seeing to back off from another girl?
the one i went to had a belly dancer and i found it lame.
she knows it is not love.
do not worry about the heroin.
i enjoy laughing and telling jokes.
it cannot be done. if they care about you, then it will hurt no matter how you phrase it,
what are you good at doing?
someone else may take the opportunity. do not be late.
why would you be mean if they are not?
cut him off now to ensure he will be use to it when you get married.
say "i love you" to get them off of their guard.
there is no point in being miserable because he does not accept you for you.
i believe that they will.
because once you have something more serious than a friendshup, it is difficult to return to being friends.
i believe that men are more sensitive but women reveal it more.
do something with your life and relax.
go ahead and send a text message.
do not remain with someone who is not right for you. it is not worth the pain.
do not believe in it at all. it is too commercialised.
he is only using you, correct?
one may be good at coitus and the other is good at listening.
you are correct, but i must do it anyway or she will be very upset.
it is what you make of it.
why is he out there sleeping in the doghouse with the dog?
do you have dreams about her when you sleep at night?
you have to network to new areas and places, be active in the activities you enjoy, and strike up conversations with new people and see where that takes you.
no, i do not feel like i want to shake hands with you at this time either.
if you are truly in love, you should not want anything other than that.
i love you so much my darling.
just have some fun and do not let it bother you, play the field!
i think that she does like me because of the flirting and all of the conversation that we have.
that is not the best point in your life, so, relax, and just do it.
it does not matter what she looks like.
it is difficult being eight years old, right?
he will ask you to marry him.
then go ahead and ask her out.
you are a little vague with the data.
naturally i have many friends who are guys, but i also have many who are girls.
(and i hope things turn out well.)
seriously, take a let it be approach from now on.
when they get married they start to act stupid and abusive.
odds are that happens only once in a blue moon.
what is the worst thing they can say?
he might be wanting to have phone sex with you. do you not want to?
are you saying there is something not good about me?
did you read what you just wrote?
priorities are an important quality to look for.
you feel them, not see them.
are you lookign to get married and settle down?
i took my neighbor to the doctors last night.
please put her in the bedroom.
tell her that you need a hug.
if he did not care, he would not care.
(i have no problem with big bottoms, but this was on a man.)
trust me when i say that you cannot change them.
it all depends, and you have to ask him first.
there is no way to know if she is a virgin until you have had intercourse so try to do it right away.
satisfy yourself but be careful and use protection!
some men just need extra stimulation to ejaculate.
i tell my boyfriend that i love him every day.
what is a girl to do?
all men love to compete.
you have to marry the one you cannot live without.
do you want to have girlfriends or boyfriends?
i think that sex is supposed to be about giving unselfishly rather than getting something for oneself.
i would say adam and eve, but they were smart.
is it always about the sex for some men?
my guess is you do not look the same to her either and that you do not inspire her to impress you.
you never know what might help. try flirting with women.
i really do think there is hope;
you are a woman, it should be easy to get a new boyfriend.
maybe you just need mr. right.
the way that she responds will tell you if she is right for you.
if you cannot commit to having a baby, then do not have intercourse.
i would believe what the woman said to you.
if you are attractive, comment on her hair, outfit, or her shoes.
once you have discussed it with her, decide where you are going to live.
being homosexual is not a good thing.
sexual intercourse between friend does not equal love to both men and women.
at least he want you to be involved.
do they feel like he does not have confidence or something like that.
i love my sister dearly, but she always seems to be in unhealthy relationships.
you don't know what will happen, which is why they call it love.
he even accepted my newborn daughter as his own child.
if you want to attract the attention of your husband, remember to use the words food and sex.
if you've watched spiderman, the upside down kiss caught him by surprise.
as thick as you would like it.
i don't think you find any pleasure from it.
it should be elaborate, and in public to show her how much she means to you.
if you're attracted to men, then you may be bisexual.
the women you have been hanging around are not good for you.
do not shy away, you may loose them.
have him close his eyes if you feel shy.
good looks do nothing if he is a jerk.
go with jamookae, he has serious emotional issues.
you might have already scared her.
let me guess, move to new zealand?
tell him your boss or just dump him and get another man in your life.
personality above all, then fit body and kindness.
we're all a little screwy around here.
you mother kicked out an innocent person.
if you haven't had intercourse yet, then wait.
i want to start having boyfriends when i am _num_, and going on date when i am _num_
the way he acts and looks at you is a tell tale sign.
my dad lose weight by getting outside.
if things do not work out, you can start over.
it is not fair that a guy can not talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating.
it means exactly what she was saying.
now i am twenty-eight years old and single.
far enough to be away from family, but close enough to allow them to visit once a month, perhaps?
say hello, then have a casual conversation with him.
they need to compete to be the most degenerate person on earth.
you do not know what a woman does when she is not with you. either trust her or leave her.
i advise you not to hold anything back.
i am trying to say what is on my mind, that is all.
i do not really even like the word stupid.
yes, my ex said the same thing once.
a dance is no more than a dance.
you have a boyfriend who loves you, and you love him as well, correct?
if you have intercourse before you are married, it is bloody and painful.
go to a vacation resort that is very important to her.
of course, if it feels right.
you seem like a very sweet person. you can do better for yourself.
my guess is between _num_ and _num_
i'm very busy, so i am unable to respond.
some men are just different.
of course she yelled about it, then.
believe me, it was long.
tell your lover how special they are to you and why they are special.
i made it, and so can you.
if they dodge the question, or get angry, then i would be worried.
have you tried talking to him?
girls like it when you make eye contact.
find a new boyfriend. there are a lot of single people out there.
i would have a mix of the two.
it is cool when you are in middle school.
remember the good times and forget the bad ones even though it takes time.
well, i think you should introduce yourself.
kudos to her for sticking with it even when she is upset!
it once happened to me.
you are the most attractive person.
how do i know if he truly loves me?
it is not a bad thing; but, it is rather humorous when the woman is taller.
there is an attraction between the two of them.
why would you do something like that, then spread the news around?
if someone doesn't invite you on a date, does that mean that you are not attractive?
you should know, love finds you; don't rush the situation.
my problem is that i make girls angry, since i'm smarter than they are.
you know what he is doing, but you do not care because you let him tell you differently.
it depends on how mature the child is.
think long and hard about it.
tell your man why you hated him.
i understand that you feel as though she is not attractive, but she is happy about the way she feels.
i have the ability to fall in love after one month.
it is like suicide. it is normal to think about it, but not to do it.
proceed and obsess over someone else.
i do not want him to be my boyfriend any longer.
how can i inform him?
in actuality, however, they are simply a negative experience.
to some degree, i prefer to date heavier men.
just have some fun, or try to keep yourself busy.
how do you know that i am madly in love with her?
you able to do many things.
i guess i have a good figure because guys are always whistling at my backside, lucky me!
the devil's hell hounds are tracking his movement.
you will have your answer when you see what she says.
is he ruining his life?
some are far out there.
they are loved because if they were not then they would not find it.
if you tell him that, it will bring him down, and he will not want to have sex with you again.
i see you have decided to leave your wife.
they are not happy missing and missing something from their relationship.
but they still want to have intercourse with you.
i would never pack a bag for my husband!
if you really love her it will really happen for sure.
it is not as simple with children.
love can be elusive to people until they actually fall in it.
it is acceptable to laugh at yourself.
have a nice day.
ask him if he would like to go on a date with you.
as for me, i am a pure-bred mexican.
i know that it is hard, but it is better for you.
that depends only on your age.
she is not romantically interested in you—or, possibly, you approached her too aggressively.
do not do something you will regret later.
my apologies, i do not know where to find him.
there are plenty of other men on this planet.
no, unless you feel you need to be skeptical about that.
they do not do anything for me.
it is odd that someone so young is answering questions here.
it costs _num_ points per answer.
why does it matter to you?
if you want to get drinks there, bring your own.
marraige is not all fun and games.
i think their husbands are not good enough.
did you find out if he is having an affair with another woman?
have you been spending time with your parents?
a woman wants a guy she can trust.
i am _num_ years old, nearly _num_, how old are you?
it is better if it is forbidden.
what is being questioned is if you mean it or not.
he would not think twice about using protection.
he broke up with you because of a rumor.
first of all, are you sure that she is in love with you?
sometimes yes, but you aren't sure if it is real love.
being a good person all of the time is boring.
the first step is to do it five times a day.
perhaps you are a bit narcissistic. you are not homosexual, but you do enjoy the sight of yourself in the mirror.
if he does not, chastise him.
you are jealous of other people holdings hands and kissing because you cannot find a man.
my grandmother tell this story far better.
i see him occasionally, and i feel i made the right decision.
don't forget to bring some for me.
why didn't they tell you?
unless she doesn't care that i slept with others.
you begin to want her more if you think about her more often.
ask the woman to accompany you to the dance.
find a woman who has similar interests as you.
also that his genitals are small.
i apologize, but that is repulsive.
leave her alone and move on.
i have heard that friend start dating and find out that they were meant to be.
customer care took care of the answers.
it is a way to show you that she does not want to attract any other men.
i do not know, if i were you, i would ask her whether or not she like you.
just be yourself, and like the first man said, "a little money will not hurt anyone."
do you think she should ask the guy?
yes, the glutinous maximus muscle is the important physical feature on a man that makes him attractive.
first kiss, sent my head spinning for a few seconds.
if he says sure, he's not cheating.
yes, so i can do the same to her.
no, unless they actually said "we're back on" then no.
do not make it seem like you are insulting her weight because she will shut down and eat more.
the person that said women commit because of money is wrong.
is there a chance they would like each other, too?
be yourself and if they do not like you for that they do not deserve you.

do not fall into love with him.
that is incredibly sad, where are you living?
if you don't mind being her backup then it is fine.
i wish you the best, do what is right even if it is painful, emotionally.
some girls like to please their man, so nobody else does.
you are making issues for him.
you shoudl play hard to get.

if you do not get it, then, you might be brainwashed.
i had to stop a kid from jay-walking/running across the street while it was raining.
i think that a lot of things are important.
you have to ask him questions directly, if he plans on staying in your life until death do us part.
if she does not like you, then, move on you are still young, but, you got to be yourself!
this is not a chat room.
you will find the one that is for you.
you do not have to kiss, but you do have to have sex.

she does not want anyone to say anything about the situation.
i proposed to her once by mistake, and she accepted.
if you do not flirt, you will never know what happens until you try.
congratulations to him and his bride; she is a lucky woman!
you would not be asking if you did not want to di it.
there was not enough feelings there for her that he would leave his wife.
i am in agreement with you.
i have my own opinions.
making love is fun, but sex can be serious and dirty.
say a prayer to guide you through the best possibilities. people enter and leave your life often.
love is not rare. do not worry and do not be rude, alright?

it is strange for him, probably.
if so, why can it not make it?
the answer is that life is wonderful.
if he is doing it by choice, it should be questioned and watched closely.
i miss him. if anyone out there knows the guy in the picture, please email me.
ask what her feelings are towards you.
don't go to your best friend's house while he is around, or make sure she is around as well.

if you're not ready to become a mother, start by practicing safe sex, use protection.

marry her at the courthouse.
always show her the best things.
dress up and act ladylike if you are a woman.
i am attractive, according to men.

i need advice, my wife and i cannot conceive.
i would be honest with him, he will most likely not care.
it is what is inside that matters.

okay, so he likes to flirt. he is attractive.
you like him, but you call him a creepy guy.
who knows? leave the people alone.

he needs an extra incentive, even though you should be a sufficient incentive.
another girl has a feelings for my crush, and i feel like i won't stand a chance with him.
just as she did to you.
a woman wants many things from men.
i am in junior high, and he is a high school junior.
you could always just ask him.
no man would bribe you to kill your child.
you just want to be yourself.
most likely it will turn into sex if you are both naked and in bed together.
it is up to you.
when it comes down to it, it is my choice.
what is the opposite of being above me?
what about the women that he cheated on you with?
a lot of my friends girlfriends as me the same question.
that guy you were dating was not a good person.
you will get over him, it is just hard right now.
make sure you are not caught up in their fights.
you have an ego.
are you kidding right now?
true love is when you are in love and never feel bored.
i do not want her to die.
simply be careful when you do it.
would i endanger myself for a friend or a stranger?
if i received the same kiss today, i would be disappointed.
neither of us could think of a preferable alternative.
i want work to be done with for today and forever.
flirt with him/her and tell her that you love him/her.
otherwise, it is just something else that may lead to a new love. you just never know.
do this before he leaves or when you first see him.
we would go for walks, but she would whine.
he does not really know her if he met her on the internet.
either he loves you or he does not.
it sounds like he already has a girlfriend.
no, it is boring to fall in love.
simply because you only use ninety percent of your effort.
instinctively, i say yes.
a nice wedding in the yard was good enough for me.
i do not think i have a small posterior.
then you are most likely stuck being their friend, if even that. i am sorry.
so he does not have a reason to hate you?
smart people are not a little too smart.
saturday morning, i pretended to be a shemale six times.

women can be friends, but men cannot, it's not in their genes.
when she's no longer attempting contact.
to a certain degree, i'd retain an opportunity to engage with her.
similar to what you did for your classroom?
it is exciting, especially when there are butterflies in your stomach!
if you want to go in the poor house, then it should take two months.
that said, just because everyone is dating, and you are not, does not mean that there is anything wrong with you.
lol is an abbreviation for "laughing out loud."
the more you let him get away with, the more freedoms he will take.
i think it was only infatuation for a few months.
it depends on the girl, if she is attracted to your body she will handle it.

consider how problematic it would be for him to be in a relationship with a girl who is in junior high school.
it may be difficult, but try to act as though you do not want it.
love is not bad. you should try it.
don't just hand it to her so easily.
as long as you are both consenting adults.
ask for her number, and if she doesn't give it to you, she isn't interested.
tell him you love them.
if he doesn't answer you directly, or tries to deceive you, you know what needs to happen.
well it all depends on how long you have been with her.
if she does not pay you attention, then forget it.
if he only like her a little, then he should not get too mad.

you should tell him that a mutual respect for one another has to be established.
take him to a bar where there are fun activities such as darts and pool.
you are happy, mature, and attractive.
do i have to get over a simple crush with no contact at all?
you could do that or you could just flirt a bit.
of course, because i would not be able to live with her death.
do not hurt her, because there are other men out there that would love to love her.
different people have different preferences; i strongly prefer doggie-style.
what will happen if the relationship does not work out?
you two should have sex frequently.
i disagree. it seems to me that you girls are too fearful.
maybe you thought there was more love then there was when you got married.
you can do these things together.
i do not like valentines day.
just be yourself and what you like to do.
only if you want your friend to watch it too.
we have phone sex everyday.
it can make it alot worse.
treat him as if you would treat a friend you haven't seen for some time.
if you're actually her friend, you won't even consider it.
i am at the point where i no longer care to give it a shot.

i all he wanted was to have sex with you, then he didn't really care about you!
i know, my ex did the same thing to me.
yes for the long term, and no for the short.
it depends on how long you have been chatting.
he should not get married to her right now.
my girlfriend is very attracted to bottoms.

men to not appreciate woman who proclaim what's necessary.

try to watch both kinds of adult films.
if he is a nice guy, it does not matter what he looks like.
i praised my god for getting her as my wife.
you cannot tell him anytime because he will probably do that if he is not gay.
i did not believe it until i saw her eyes.
she might be playing hard to get, or she genuinely likes you and does not admit it.
do you want to talk about what is going on?
why do girls have facial hair?
it is hard to get rid of the memories.
ask your older sister again.
suprise her and give her little gifts during the dinner.
yeah, he knows that he doesn't know me.
in my partner's eyes, i am.

i used to exhibit the same behavior.
you'll never get any peace, if you remain by his side.
forget about him. do not go out of your way to make him think you are over him.
i hope not. i have enough trouble with homosexual people admiring me.
it means that she probably would not have left you if you would have been more calm in the past.
maybe you married the wrong man?
yes, but i hope i never have to.
men are saying no to something women want.
you do not want to keep wondering your whole life.
you can go someplace with your boyfriend when you have time.

what was this all about?
you know what you want.

no, are you male or female?
most people do not even get that far.
are you and your spouse still together?
one alternative would be to put an aid in the local newspaper.
simply observe your surroundings. i believe this is both hell and heaven.
tell him not to bother her. he ought to be looking for a different one.
if we want money that you merely want sex rather than love.
she is not even in college yet and the two of you would like to have a serious relationship?
that is impressive and we ought to thank him every day for the wonderful feelings of arousal.
do not buy her edible underwear if you want the sex to be special.
your last course of action is to pray.
do they love you, or, are they just telling you that?
are you trying to commit suicide?
i want both great kissing and great sex.
my friend had no idea how badly she hurt me.
you should only be straight forward.
listen, he loved you in the beginning, and he wouldn't want you to have an abortion.
if you are really in love, buy a plane ticket and go get married to them.
you need to relax for awhile.
i have never had sex with a man who didn't have an excellent physique.
you have created a very complicated problem.
why do you not ask him on a date?
i personally would want my daughter to be homosexual, because i know how most men behave.
then it will not be breaking the law because you will be holding her for ransom rather than going on a date with her.
if you ask a question you may get an answer rather than only points.
some people are just ignorant and that is all it is; just try to be there for them.
you should ask her and she should be honest in telling you.
however, according to me it is unfair.
if they do not like sex toys, that did not help them.
what if we got married one day?
you can not please another human being. just be yourself.
the problem is that you are already married.
you can not change their mind, or make them put the toilet seat down.
wow! well, i have been in that situation.
i know this is a lot to remember, but trust me!
please help and tell me what to do.

she is manipulating you, that is what my neighbor mentioned.
you have a significant history with him, so you know his true character.
you could say, "hello dear, would you like to have a soda?"
i guess i am not too concerned about it.
he is an inspiration, however i don't want to get involved, but i would love to see him up close.
p.s. the muslim question is funny.
i am sure that is what a man would want.
i think the same thing about wrestling.
it is not your fault as they are very weak minded.

you notice her looks and that is all!

when a person is hot like you, it is worth it.
yes, with a poem written on the cake.

it cannot be covered in hair.
you will know and you will feel it.
i would not doubt him.
ours go to their breasts.
what is wrong with you?
that sounds very good, except for the six months part. five it some time.
the best way is to tell them.
ask, if you cannot tell.
tell your parents that you love them and move forward with your life.
love is love. god does not care.
boys want sincere, caring females that can accomodate them in life.
they feel like they are not needed by their husbands.
listen to your gut feeling.
open it, and ask her.
what is her favorite restuarant?
if you ask me about boys, i can give you an answer.
it sounds like he has issues being faithful.
i am having a bad day.
someone is tracking his every step.
tell her to find something to do with her life.
you'll be unable to do what your speaking about.
in the event he actually is unfamiliar with the females, it should have no impact.
he will love you more.
my wife kissed me, then left with the children.
my contact information is _num_@yahoo.com. i enjoy meeting new people.
i do not know. perhaps i am simply incapable of lying too much.
that is what i decided on matt.
you can go to the beach or a restaurant.
it does not mean that he does not love you.
it sounds as though he is pretending not to be interested and you are not.
i like the doggystyle position.
the other saturday i had to pretend to be both a male and female six times.
it will be hard if he doesn't notice you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
you should hit him on the head.
if you have to ask questions of that nature, then, you should go out and get that job.
talk to him first.
i really do not think much about it.
however, each time i return, the same difficulties arise again.
if she likes you, she will accept that you're a beginner.
you certainly should! you ought to break up with him.
we are now friends after i asked her to dance.
i reccommend that you call her and inform her of your feelings for her.
it is good that you are experiencing new things.
what they said is true.
you will loose it if you do not use it.
do not be late, someone else may take the opportunity.
yes, it is, but are you in love?
on the contrary, he tells me that they have no meaning for him.
employ a replacement individual to inform him on your behalf.
i believe he was a friend once.
you sister may have a suitable solution for you problem.
that depends on your gender.
are you implying that i am not a good person?
there are many young women on earth.
press ahead and leave this behind, my friend. have fun.
that should not be a factor at all if you like her.
why would she miss someone that was never hers in the first place.
no one can ever be exactly what you are.
you feel them, not see them.
do not worry about those types of things.
it is exciting, especially when he makes you feel the way that you do.
as a male, i think it relates to sex.
why are men stronger, tougher, and more honest and hardworking?
a query which resulted in your hysterical reaction.
you should not marry her, she is using you to her benefit.
you will need good luck.
do not ask him. annoy him until he asks you on a date.
you should look over photos of young men.
he either wants a break, thinks you are boring, or he is seeing someone else.
you can do this, but please do not do it, you deserve more.
i'm uncertain since my spouse-to-be and myself both have that quality.
she will love you all the more if you love and trust her.
i make so much noise our neighbors have made complaints against us.
well, he won't be in a marriage for a significant future period.
i think the same thing about wrestling.
you will feel it, and that is when you will know.
correct, it is the french that was being employed by all. however, this also serves the purpose.
if you find the answer to that question, please let me know.
are there any other concerns that you shouldn't attempt to date him.
listen to your intellect and emotions.
jealousy is a difficult emotion to overcome.
in my opinion, it would be interesting.
honey, you can trust me because i am a guy
ask your older sister again.
read this and tell her to stop.
my partner doesn't behave as such. he simply doesn't hesitate to begin and becomes immediately immersed.
select my avatar and look at my questions. they are very similar.
i am confused because he has too many female friends.
i believe being in a relationship is wonderful.
just kiss him out of the blue one day.
i intensely want to resume our relationship.
at least he would like for you to be involved.
seducing women feels like an achievement.
tell him to go away.
purchase a bouquet of roses for her for valentine's day and invite her on a date.
you're not genuinely required to request her romantic partnership.
if you think he is attractive and have feelings for him, try asking him out.
if it is during intercouse, i do not think that she is a virgin.
you can contact me at _num_@hotmail.com, then we can talk about this more later.
there is not even free lunch, or even fireworks.
i enjoy receiving advice.
you have to be normal.
it's difficult ambulating to converse with a woman.
do not ask via text as that is just lame.
planning is good, but don't plan excessively.
she has been living for you.
this is the first time i have ever done something for someone else, advice would be lovely.
it is not fair that a guy can not talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating.
i was chatting with a man for approximately two hours.
you are very earth-friendly.
that only mean that you like yourself.
defend yourself no matter what happens.
the duplicate reason that the majority of women are simpleminded.
your life will be over if you try that.
i very much want to but i do not want to do it meaninglessly.
if each week there is a different one, then i doubt it. you should, however, check the signs, especially eye contact and flirting.
why be so worried sweetie, love conquers all in the end!
trust me, i consider myself a relationship doctor.
if i am interested in a man, then i ask him on a date before another woman does.
however, that takes some time to develop.
bill gates was probably undesirable, but look at him now!
regardless of sex, god is happy when two people have mutual love.
men want women to behave nicely in public and promiscuously in private.
i have no certainty, prepare his dinner meal, demonstrate your empathy.
he or one of your friends who knows him might know. ask one of them.
she does not want you.
it is all in how you use it man, it is never the size.
no, i do not care about that of my boyfriend.
you could go out with one of his friends and then gauge his reaction.
you have some work to do.
what enjoyable activities can i do with her after school?
have a serious talk and tell her that she is getting older, and this behavior is childish.
we are better liars than men.
they all feel you are a jerk.
at that point, determine if he desires to continue being together.
you cannot just force yourself on anyone, or you will end up with noone.
do not act as though you are pure.
i suggest that you introduce yourself.
i will try anything once, and i will do it again if i enjoy it.
do not do anything.
he is more mature because he is three to five years older.
you do not want to spend the rest of your life with someone like thant, do you?
in my opinion, if your instinct tells you that there is something going on, then there is.
do not be foolish and ill-advised. you should strife for average in intelligence.
now, most people have had past sexual experiences.
basically, it is deciding who i want to marry.
either one works; i guess it depends on the day and our moods.
he's untruthful, and disconnects the phone when i'm speaking.
if you wait, you will not get anywhere.
is he ruining his life?
no, but in any case who is really happy?
do you like someone asking you for a date?
everything reminds me of him and what it used to be.
although you said it was mutual, i expect he would go to jail here.
after one month, i can fall in love.
if you don't find him trustworthy, then how can you two love each other?
why does my former boyfriend continue attempting to arouse jealousy?
what is the worst thing that they could say?
have one of your family members take pictures and recording if you rent.
she may act like that again, but thank you i will be sure to tell him.
i do not get overly concerned about it.
are you and your partner still together?
pretend to like it, even though you may not.
find some barry white songs, they work for setting the mood.
you do not have to have a relationship.
i am a twenty year-old woman.
however, an excess of positive circumstances may transform into a hindrance.
and you merely want to be genuine.
it is okay to be emotional while talking to her.
it is about the one with whom you are.
i suggest that you focus first on becoming a friend to a woman.
i would be very disappointed if i got taht same kiss today.
my girlfriend is perfect, my love, my everything.
it is hard to find friends.
i know because my ex did the same thing to me.
a little bit of both.
behave naturally and observe the occurrences.
you will say 'you can't hurt me anymore' when you are angry.
go get a breast reduction, and you'll look great.
you are not getting any, my friend.
i would not break up with my girlfriend for someone who sent me nude photographs.
he is just talking, do not run.
they better not cheat on you and write you a note about it.
do not speak with him, he is not the man for you. he's giving you terrible advice.
i made the right choice because i see him once in a while.
he is a _num_-year-old guy who is a virgin.
it is dependent upon whether or not you still care for her.
you should not be having sex in the first place.
it is alright for you to like him even if others do not.
he even had intercourse with the wife of his best friend.
they are very nice.
and what does it mean?
who can assemble me again?
save for your closest companion making this suggestion, my opinion is under no circumstances.
you will not get anywhere with these people so you should leave them.
i see others the way i want to see them.
i only did that so i would not feel lonely.
i'm sure they feel the same way about women.
less than every single female, however, certain females behave in such a manner.
i would be worried if they dodge the question and/or get angry.
if he truly loved you he would not have wanted you to have an abortion.
was his response that you should stay the cours, that he was mistaken, or that he did not love you?
i would like to have you next to me.
why do men continuously lie?
if she wants to confuse you, i suppose it is time to leave her for someone new.
mind your personal hygiene.
try searching somewhere other than where degenerates spend time.
do not do something which you will later regret.
if i married the lady of my dreams, that would be everything that i have dreamed of.
i've attended a small amount in the past.
i have dated guys who are tall and muscular.
in my opinion, most men are not unintelligent.
mine is large in size.
when a woman is interested in you, you should be able to notice. substantiate me, women.
are you certain that is what you want?
in the event he communicates a farewell to you, your relationship was not destined to be.
are you even still not familiar with the paris hilton video recording?
i need someone i can really love.
both of you should attempt to be understanding, to adjust accordingly.
some light hair is fine, but not really hairy how men's chests can become.
tell your family that the person makes you happy.
support her if she is fine with her appearance.
no i did not, i waited until the man asked me out on a date.
the man is married!
let them know you love them, and see if they tell you the same thing.
you have every right to be upset.
are you sure you want to be with someone unsure of what he wants?
my friends don't like him, and make fun of him often.
you are among the worst people in the world.
but, the difficult part is making this person stay with us.
go ahead and send a text message.
not being a virgin is a sin in the eyes of the lord.
all right, his age is between _num_ and _num_, and your age is what?
you are happy, mature, and attractive.
it is bad when men do that.
it cannot be covered in hair.
look for a person who wants to spend their future with you.
he loves you because you are his alone.
he likely believes it is a good thing.
things that make me no longer aroused are body odor, passing gas, and constant belching.
i still think about him.
you can ask him out, and see how he responds.
it was a different time, with different ladies.
trust me when i say that you cannot change them.
you do not need him or anyone else to degrade you.
he loves me more, because i was a virgin on our wedding night.
if you are really in love, buy a plane ticket and go get married to them.
i enjoy watching a woman masturbate and will have sex with her as soon as she finishes.
you should let her know your true feelings.
women can be friends, but not men?
simply behave as an unruffled man, refrain from treating girls presumptuously.
somewhere inside yourself you are strong.
she will break up her current relationship and make a move.
in such an event, what's the duration of your marriage?
inquire as to whether he feels affection for your progeny. if not so inclined, end the relationship since relatives occupy first position.
that is another story.
would i tell my husband to leave?
i've heard that men prefer virginal women.
do you take issue with this?
i apologize, but since i do not live there i cannot give you advice.
you are a sinner if the people you call friends are unsaved.
i recommend going to movies, going sight-seeing, and other similar activities.
we frequently meet and have similar feelings.
inform her that you've been wishing to share with her some information.
you wouldn't want it just once.
he did it one time, it means he will do it again.
you need to leave her.
i care very much regarding him. i yearn for him.
what is wrong with enjoying yourself?
i hope not. i have enough trouble with homosexual people admiring me.
my friend claims she loves me.
she may have an underlying reason for eating like that.
does this sound familiar?
they simply want to be loved.
i want her to be interested in me.
our family hated that it was an interracial relationship. my father and great grandmother on his side were angry.
i'm intending to say, a beautiful appearance is merely surface-level in depth.
because the color red is the color of blood but most people consider blue to be the color of love.
do you really want him back in your life?
you just use the restroom from there, and did not even wipe yourself?!
you would do best to leave him and strike out on your own.
that was unfortunate. in the future, at no time will the television be powered simultaneously as sexual intercourse occurs.
you will be a good sister.
he started flirting with me one day.
men will be jealous that you're interested in him, and not them.
it's so natural, why make and issue out of it?
i repeat, this is something that you want to tell him face to face.
the headboard thing ruined the mood, and i did not get to come.
i love my wife very much.
if they agree to the request, you should ask him to spend time with you.
i am _num_ years old and i waited until marriage to have sex.
do they hold the opinion that he lacks confidence?
he does not want to use a condom.
do you imagine she'll be aware of your affection independent of your revelation to her?
i cannot because i am starting to fall in love.
girls like it when you are odd.
someone you love will always be there whether you are happy or sad.
then you can certainly do these things together!
there is a simple answer, just do not do it.
have you tried hard?
a man can work form sun up to sun down, but a womans job is never done.
that description sounds surprisingly similar to flirtation.
the female you are partial towards will be alone, and she states that that is less than desirable.
i like him but i do not love him.
it doesn't matter if you're doing everything accurately.
if you never try to have a relationship, you will never what might have happened between the two of you.
do not be afraid to tell him what you want.
you are beginning to dislike the friends of the person to who you love.
but, do you know what i had to do to overcome this?
you should try love because it is not bad.
some guy followed me in a store and acted scary.
i think that sex is supposed to be about giving unselfishly rather than getting something for oneself.
inform her that were she to feel romantically towards you, she would visit and engage in wild sexual intercourse and ingest your ejaculate.
it is like suicide, it is normal to think about it, but not to act upon those thoughts.
my male friends say confidence is key.
if he truly cared about you, the little things would matter to him.
i think about him all the time.
you can get ideas off the knot website.
you are already married, so what is the problem?
he will ask for your hand in marriage.
i want a man to be true to himself.
you can do what you like.
the ones that come from out of nowhere, are the one that are truly genuine from the heart.
i would sacrifice my life for the woman i love because if she died i would not want to live any long.er
if he does not do what you want, discipline him.
i know that he also would not want me to do it.
don't tell him that you want to have intercourse.
be concerned when he sees someone else.
i do not know about love.
i am humbly (and laughingly) stating that i have all the qualities you have mentioned.
i would not necessarily break off a friendship simply because we have a disagreement.
in yahoo! chat, i communicate quite a bit in that forum.
you should become accustomed to men devaluing you as a person.
have intercourse with people who are good at mathematics. they know how to handle curves.
i do not like that.
one day you wake up with the knowledge.
trust me that i know, i am married.
you need to be careful before you get pregnant.
if he is trying to exert control over you, break off the relationship.
i'm uncertain of your feelings, however, i'm not fond of the ne'er-do-well personality.
if someone loves you they will accept you regardless of anything.
love is love. god does not care.
that is not very fair to the man with whom you are currently in a relationship.
i despise that type. remember that money can purchase many things but class, style and grace are not among them.
it depends on the size of the male gentialia.
i tried to converse with him, but he has yet to call me.
my man works out so he has a nice bottom.
i would not doubt him.
raise yourself, because he has no obligation to feed you.
stay with him if you want to be with him.
ask him. you might feel awkward, but the awkward moment will be worth it if he does love you.
i you are in bangalore, then i am here.
i am always happy including when waking up this morning and at work right now.
you must inquire of yourself whether you have feelings for him!
if she is not willing, stop trying to do it.
however, i have learned that a man will show it if he really likes you.
by then you won't be speaking with her, if or when your sentiments change.
there is no tension between me and my guy friends, who are like brothers to me.
what did you do in that class?
i would ask her if she likes you or not.
that is very insensitive of her to do such things in your presence.
i am always attracted to boorish men. what is wrong with me?
cling and pray to jehovah god, and to his son jesus christ, as your last recourse!
take her out, maybe go shopping.
i promise that every female who believes she excessively obsesses over sexual activity has no actual understanding.
it will cost you three points for each answer.
i believe that it is a myth and that you are all intercouse addicts.
you should leave him alone because he got what he wanted and perhaps no longer wants to talk to you.
i could please use some advice from other people.
your chile wants you to be present, and sending money is not preferrable to that.
don't simply stand around waiting for a good thing.
i need advice, my wife and i cannot conceive.
it depends on the mood of my wife is in at the time.
i've married two times. with the first one, i knew right away. my second marriage is still unravelling.
if you email me, i will tell you everything that i know.
you've admitted he is in love with someone else.
you should believe in yourself, which is really sexy.
because their thinking is not clear.
stay out of this until time calms them down.
men will not consider cheating if the sex remains interesting and exciting.
if you approach slowly, her body language will tell you what you need to know.
girls want attention, and some good chocolate.
i don't appreciate that ignorant word.
it depends upon your age.
if you love other people, they will love you in return.
where he asked you out is his decision, and you made a mistake.
you should tell him that a mutual respect for one another has to be established.
you will get out only what you put in.
have you ever comitted a felony?
finding love is the real reason for your success.
adopt the persona of a young lady searching for an nsa coupling and send an im to him.
it hurts your partner if you go out for fun when you are in a relationship.
i want to be with my ex boyfriend.
oh goodness, that must have been a really hard feeling.
some males genuinely do not prefer any sort of contact with their derrieres.
love can be elusive to people until they actually fall in it.
how many minutes into the first date did you mean?
not all men have sexual relations as their main focus.
there might be a reason for that behavior.
i do not think my bottom is like that of a chicken.
i am a woman and only think about sex if i am in love with a man.
if he has friends, then maybe he is interested in you.
i am unsure, but if you find mine please let me know as i would like it returned.
i think he will cheat you sometime because he already cheated your cousin.
you are not considerate unless to return the favor.
i miss him and if anyone knows him, please send me an email.
what is a relationship if you cannot discuss such subjects?
i don't believe it's a sin, although it terminates in fornication.
but have fun if you decide to do it.
from the sound of it, you are more interested in virginity than are most guys.
my boyfriend and i broke up after eight years. i really did love him.
it was an eye-opening experience for me.
what are your thoughts on marriage?
can i receive custody even though he has been staying hom with the child?
i believe you have a boyfriend.
it can work for you too.
they are no longer best friends.
we never got together, though, because he regarded me as his best friend.
he even accepted my newborn daughter as his own child.
take it easy on the spending.
find out what it is you don't want to do.
get involved in things she likes whether or not you are too shy or hate it.
that sounds a bit strange to me. could she be hiding something?
it all depends on the mood that you are in, there are so many factors.
most men are in constant need of intercourse.
are you able to handle a serious relationship?
give her one in front of everyone and observe her reaction.
have you read what you have written?
you are the best at it.
you will know him better if you continue to flirt, and care for him.
when it comes down to it, it is my choice.
no matter how long it takes to stop caring about them.
i can loan you a few dollars.
should i discontinue our relationshp or continue it in the hope she indeed loves me?
to surprise her, tell her in the middle of a conversation.
it seems to me that love does not die so quickly.
i am intersted in him, however, i do not know that he is intersted in me.
i want it more than guys do.
try thinking about how they feel.
what in the world should i do then?
a woman wants many things from men.
if you want to listen to more, send me an email.
i agree, but i don't feel that it is a poor decision.
she can see how happy you are because she has realized what she has thrown away.
exclusively one, the initial and the concluding.
because once you have something more serious than a friendshup, it is difficult to return to being friends.
the admiration is friendly and just not enough reason to kiss.
you can tell if it is too long if the woman finds it painful and it does not fit.
you can not change their mind, or make them put the toilet seat down.
he wants you to do this so he feels more comfortable cheating.
i would be suspicious of him being unfaithful.
no i am not soft on discipline, i am just trying to be fair.
it is a way of showing that she does not want to attract other men.
that is what men do.
he did not want a second chance.
he'll become jealous. inform him how you dislike that as well.
perhaps you become too attached after intercourse and it frightens men into leaving.
young lady, it is alright if you do not want to have sex with a man.
does it matter since you received yours?
it is hard to get rid of the memories.
my name is shaba, please send me a friend in amsterdam.
women like strong men.
you need to be careful.
some men are just different.
if you are being yourself and they do not like you, they do not deserve you.
if they make you happy, you fine with no flirting.
it is simple:; purchase a flower for him and tell him that you love him.
do you still love him?
keep your main boyfriend, and then go and find you a side lover!
your mother made you leave, therefore she no longer has the ability to influence you.
it serves as the single item extremely sober-minded women are sober-minded in regard to.
i assume that you have attempted talking to him.
it is best to move on if he just wants to be friends.
don't let anyone convince you otherwise.
why would you be mean if they are not?
let him go if he continues to harass you.
giving him a hug may not have been the best solution.
i have not met the right person yet.
i am quite mature, so it would be unwise to cross me.
why didn't they tell you?
there was a wolf and a lab.
send him a post card from bora bora.
you are going to find someone that will make you forget about him.
go to the library or walmart to meet attractive women.
yes it is possible; in fact, it happens to me frequently.
furthermore, you are hoping that he will propose marriage to you.
a girl is testing you when she looks towards you.
thank you for helping to plan my wedding!
the more you let him get away with, the more freedoms he will take.
you will not be disappointed if you try it sometime.
you really should find a younger guy to date.
no, i would prefer the woman who rejected me die suddenly. i will not care about her at all anymore.
the ego is very conflicting.
it depends on the circumstances.
in my opinion a woman should make that decision for herself.
all the clues from the secret admirer led up to you.
if you break up with a guy, and he is not completely desperate, he probably will not ask you out again.
is the a possibility you could be pregnant?
you should ask him out on a date, if he is interested.
you should refuse to get together with her if she has been drinking.
i discovered that my girlfriend was actually a man.
be friendly, not direct, etc.
i like famous singers, and i have seen you on a cd!
existence possesses such a quality, individuals causing pain for one another.
they have to be relaxed and in the mood for love.
i would be honest with him, he will most likely not care.
we have been talking approximately four to five months.
i hope you find new friends.
when i went out there i noticed the same thing!
no, but the reason is that men's hormones are different from women's.
i like a girl with small breasts and a cute behind.
how am i going to be able to handle not being a jealous girlfriend.
if it has been a long time, then you should say 'no' in response.
they are weak minded, it is not your fault.

why was he imprisoned?

i am positive he will be satisfied.
pity does not cause me to have intercourse with you.
is it normal to have intercourse with one's boyfriend?
it does not have anything to do with you, though.
you should approach them first.
no one knows as in the end it is all up to you.
no, not unless they specifically said that it is no longer cancelled.
she is not romantically interested in you—or, possibly, you approached her too aggressively.
i do not think there is anythign wrong with it.
you will know you are in love when you can not stop thinking about the person.
you are a forty-year-old woman and should look for someone around your age.
marriage results in people acting irresponsible and abusive.
i would believe he is having sex with another person.
it depends on how things are.
would you go out with me if i am a boy?
it is not just for lovers.
would i endanger myself for a friend or a stranger?
i am curious as to what this was all about.
you attempt to maneuver its direction at a measured pace. no man enjoys learning of his own sub-par kissing skill.
it cannot be done. if they care about you, then it will hurt no matter how you phrase it,
we want to get to know eachother better.
he is about _num_-_num_ years old, and he has a crush on me.
it may be hard, but act like you're not interested.
so, make sure she is aware of how much you care about her.
what are the signs of a man flirting with you?
you ask her and see if she replies honestly.
flirt with them and say you love them.
time is of the essence, you should move on.
he screamed when he was looking for his razor.
it means that she probably would not have left you if you would have been more calm in the past.
break off relations with him. you're squandering your days by remaining in a relationship.
neither of us could think of a preferable alternative.
my sister has since broken up with him, but she is pregnant with his child.
find her something with meaning.
when she's no longer attempting contact.
i forgot about an important question for women: have you ever used the sample cosmetics at the shopping mall?
there is still a sense of hope for these young women.
do not say that because most men are not of low intelligence.
yes, i will not be in a relationship with a large man.
i know that he is jim.
it is when she infrequently has sex with you.
don't have intercourse with him for a little bit, it will drive him crazy.
why would he refuse to speak with me?
after that, i learned that he is interested in me.
i get hungry two times every day.
ask, she will probably like if you can help.
it would be in places where african american men are.
by the way, there are plenty of commercials that will tell you condoms are not adequate protection, but something is better than nothing!
can you please look into it for me?
she might be able to pretend with other things, but that is one thing she can not fake.
but it really depends on the woman and her confidence in her natural beauty.
however, exclusively on occasions when they're sexually inclined or if you add spice to the occasion.
the best revenge is to move on and forget that he existed.
you need to be loyal, nice, friendly, and sweet.

have fun or stay busy.
only if you feel like you are in need of a boyfriend.
men are hunters, just like dogs. they enjoy the hunt but prefer the chase. so run.
what can i do to find out if my boyfriend is in love with me?
your question is making people aware of the fact that you are unattached.
or i am merely afraid or timid.
be careful you are going down a dangerous pathway.
it will hinder your ability to do amusing things with people.
correct, i imagine i'm attracted to criminal-type men.
do not be tied up; go out and have fun.
you will find out quickly if you undress in front of him!
if you can recommend me to some of them i would appreciate it, thank you in advance.

not unless her age is twice your age.
which people are the most important to you?
she knows that it is time for her to move on, but she can not, do you have any suggestions that might help her?
i hope he asks you on a date.

i am asking because it seems that men are always ready for sex.
it is a sexual story as well.
i apologize, but that is repulsive.
hey, brother, if you do not have a miami address, you're best served by traveling to this location. it is the most ideal.
if you like her, ask her out.
i do not. although, homer simpson is attractive.
tell him that he is an attractive vampire.
i do not believe in astrology.
when you find your diamond in the ruff, hopefully he will want you for you.
the one i went to had a belly dancer and i found it lame.
nobody has the ability to dictate their dream's behavior.
perhaps that is why they are called fantasies.
you could ask him.
is he into sex toys?
do exciting activities, such as covering yourselves in whipped cream or some other delicious food.
i bet you will get him, so good luck.
do not allow her to confuse you.
tell them that you are sad.
certain people are unable to exist without it and others are able to.
it could be a friend, a spouse, or even a family member.
it can work if you want it to.
are you serious about your age because i am twenty-five.
it is too strange.
she is manipulative and wants someone she can toy with.
older children might enjoy putt putt golf, laser tag, or go-karts.
if that does not work, tell him you have an sexually transmitted disease.
inform her that it disturbs you. if she doesn't terminate, hasten departure.
a lot of women here that are from the philippines, met their partner online and got married.
please explain why you did not ask him out.
if being apart makes them happy, then you should be happy too.
when he knows i am not paying attention, he will stare at a woman.
he's no longer seeing me.
you have a significant history with him, so you know his true character.
you are living in a fantasy, not reality.
the next day i went with my boyfriend to dinner.
he's not fond of your children, you're not fond of his?
it would be better if it was a chess cake.
that will show her she is important compared to your friends.
if it is about love and you can then it is probably good.
there are alot of other guys.
why can she not see because we all can.
we have flirted a lot, but i am still unsure.
you should sit them down, let them know that they should be understanding, and support you.
there are many sexual questions i get asked.
cut him off now to ensure he will be use to it when you get married.
and you can start any time, so long as you have protection.
you have to be straight forward.
i would work some more with him.
i married the sister of my high school sweetheart.
pregnant females become less interested in that fashion.
do you own a nice cast iron skillet?
you have to ask him questions directly, if he plans on staying in your life until death do us part.
i have been on dates, though not as many as i could have if i had pretended to be unintelligent.
he says that he respects and understand my desire to wait.
what should i say?
don't let it affect you so severely.
life is like a roller coaster; you need to adapt to it.
forget him if he is joking about liking you.
it is as people say: there is someone for everyone.
do you know how i know that he did not love you?
try to watch pornography together.
what are a girl's options?
get out of the relationship. then continue with your life.
you do not date a friends younger sister.
if he genuinely loves you, then he would not care whether or not you have anything to offer.
if he doesn't pay child support, call the police.
do not tell anyone.
is that question directed for men?
converse with her and discover whether or not she is interested in you.
if you are attracted to men, you might be bisexual.
she apparently never recovered from breaking up with you the first time.
how can i inform him?
how am i supposed to handle a situation such as this?
depend on the woman because she will do it if she likes your bottom.
i am merely attempting to avoid quarrels. she becomes jealous with ease.
you experience the most incredible sensation you've experienced so far in your entire existence.
i want her to realize what will happen before something bad happens.
one is made aware by the manner in which they view you and the manner employed by that individual to converse with you.
i begin quietly then gradually crescendo until i suddenly blast it loudly.
i've learned lots of new information, that i wasn't aware of before.
simply inform her of your feelings and the reason you feel lovingly towards her.
the one that i had with your mother.
ok, ask me one question at a time, you are confusing me.
i am certain that is what a man would want.
you will have your answer when you see what she says.
it is also good, and i invested in a food business there.
what should i try because i want to spice things up.
i make a different choice every so often.
go on many dates with different men in order to forget him.
you have two choices. get over him, or wait for him.
ponder it. my opinion is to terminate the relationship.
we can talk about it if you want.
sure, if you are a boy.
i thought that i would never be asked out on a date, but someone finally asked me.
you are most likely too young to get married if you are asking these questions.
i did not cheat on my wife when i was married.
but a woman will never admit it.
who knows, so you should let them alone.
just laugh, you will feel better.
you should make sure you want to communicate.
you need to tell your partner and attempt to understand him. help youself by helping each other.
hopefully one they they will see the truth.
before you make a big mistake, have a conversation about this.
there is no better way than to tenderly tell him right away.
you should ask him to join you at dinner or a film.
getting her intoxicated and then kissing her worked for me.
pray for guidance as people will come and go in your life.
have your parents hung out with the two of you before?
no, it is only if they are sick.
i would not want him to.
reflect on his personality, is he a nice, decent person?
be a friend. allow him some time to be alone.
allow your personality to show. do not pretend to be someone else, women can sense that.
it is easy to say yes, but i suspect it would be difficult to actually do.
refrain from initiating action because she'll receive her due at some future date and time.
i am afraid to ask him if he is still interested in me, because i used to feel the same.
i think that people always want what they cannot have.
send me more information if you need help.
do we want our moms to be liars?
girls are not bad liars.
did you ask him what caused him to be unfaithful?
it is better to tell someone news over the phone or in person.
it is not as simple with children.
distance makes it harder to lie.
on top of the covers with the lights off and a few candles lit.
after a few days he broke up with me.
love is caring for someone or something.
wait because you are still a child.
that means you can have both options without leaving anything.
if he says no, then he is being unfaithful.
return to pleasuring yourself orally.
no, are you male or female?
i would do it as it costs nothing.
if you still desire your ex, don't approach anyone new.
my husband and i moved in two weeks ago. you should go for it.
it is the same reason as mine.
some men simply need some additional stimulation to complete the task, so to speak.
you should continue if you like him.
who goes on in mens' heads?
no, he knows that we are not acquainted with one another.
do not allow if if you do not want it, even if he never admits to it.
men do not think with their heads.
it is personality that makes women happy.
when you are attracted to a man, who is attracted to you.
trust me even though i know it is quite a bit to remember.
remember, this man needs to help with your expenses as well.
allow him to become inebriated, then remove your clothing.
have intercourse with someone you love.
i would probably not date an adult entertainer.
i do not care for large breasts.
then jon inquired if i would become jealous if spent time with another woman named alyssa.
what do you enjoy doing?
my thoughts and attention span on this disappeared, and i suspect other men's thoughts and attention did too.
if you can make them laugh, they will love you.
one said, 'i cannot leave my kids.' the other asked, 'why did you ask me to have coffee with you?'
my guess is between _num_ and _num_
if she does not like you, then, move on you are still young, but, you got to be yourself!
what did you expect?
try it. you may find that you enjoy not being consumed with sexual desire.
my husband and i was married on july _num_ of _num_ we went to hawaii for two weeks for our honeymoon.
how do i get out of it?
are you in love with him?
perhaps you'd best feel no concern whatsoever.
true love is when you are in love and never feel bored.
what reason exists for your failure to obtain employment; in such a case, you'd have your own funds.
if you make each other happy then, then do what you know.
i simply desire a selection of quality romance tunes to enjoy. i'm aware of the sappiness quotient, however, so what?
you will not come across as being cheep if you do not have sex with him.
what should a person do who is interested in a woman who may or may not also be interested?
the chase is over once they are interested.
that does not mean he doesn't care for you!
he could not have noticed that.
due to the majority behaving as oversexed morons unable to obtain it at all.
how old are you? also, i would like to be your friend.
the decision is entirely up to you but don't spend too much time looking.
do not probe, let him tell you when he feels competent enough to do it.
that is very revealing.
the money might be nice, but there is more going on behind the scenes.
if you do not act quickly, you might loose the one you love to someone else.
you can learn from this.
should i break up with him or not?
your age difference is rather drastic, so you should be careful.
i laughed very hard when i read it.
go to a party, and strike a conversation with the party goers.
because they believe they're well-liked and attractive and they simply possess those qualities in regard to courting.
tell him the worst thing he can say is no.
i want to be respected, and i would like him to be kind.
he is not worth your time anyways!
what do you think?
the gentleman my friend likes claims that he would like to get to know her better.
we girls will never know the answer to that question.
i think you should since women feel mature for their age.
are you in love with someone?
i stopped a child who was running across the street in the rain from jay walking.
do not give him want he wants so easily, because it will give him too much control faster than what you want.
it is strange that someone so young is answering questions on here.
if you would like to, you can have intercourse.
do not allow a man to control you.
did he volunteer the information or did you catch him?
is it really wise to marry a man accused of two attempted murders?
you must accept the truth, even though it is sad.

have them take a quality lie detector test.
i am having a terrible day as well.
even when his phone is on silent mode, he can see the missed calls.
where do you live?
set up a dinner date with her.
in actuality, however, they are simply a negative experience.
phone sex is an alternative to having sex.

i don't believe that would be at all useful.
she favors dyeing her hair various colors.
this is your time and your life.
i do not know.
have a nice day.
do it for your man.
in the event its size makes occupying the mouth impossible.
how old are you and your mother?
so how do i go about telling them?
some people are just very ignorant.
does he care about relatable subjects or not?
that is not nice if you do that to your friend.
excellent appearance, refined tendencies, and, without a doubt, an excellent physique constitutes a desirable female companion.
it will be painful either way.
they have never had anyone treat them that way, so they are apathetic.
what do you mean because it seems like you know nothing about women.
do you have a website photo page, or similar?
start by telling her that you want to kiss her.
it is painful when you have sex.
i would not concern myself with heroin.
you might love him, but you need to leave him.
some men have a cute appearance from behind.
there are beautigul girls everywhere.
_num_, jj, and i go to school with him.
people invent many reasons to explain why they have not found the right person.
it sounds like he needs to mature.
you should let her try a sports' bra on.
i have been nice to her continuously. what else is there to do?
you two broke up so let him take care of it.
this is the best way to find your answer.
i agree with gab's observation that there is no way to know.
finally, the muslim question is hilarious.
the upside down kiss in spider-man caught him off guard.
you should not think that way because it can give everyone the impression that you are unintelligent.
do they genuinely love you, or are they simply stating their love without proof?
you know they are merely dreams.
i find a hairy chest and chin to be attractive.
he is ignoring you for the same reason that we ignore you.
do i have to get over my crush?
i proposed to her once by mistake, and she accepted.
what is it was a guy?
it is not the only things that is true.

it isn't necessary, but it is incredibly helpful.
my answer was, yes, very much so.
from the sound of it, he already has a girlfriend.
whether or not you are wearing a skirt and heeled shoes or loose jeans.
he clearly is attempting to engage a different female, therefore, i would withdraw.
tell him that it is over, in a nice way.
i would never pack a bag for my husband!
you need to find someone else. and stop stalking them.
avoid being idiotic, as i have seemed.
i understand as i have the same problem.
it was disgusting when my girlfriend bit my phallus off then proceeded to eat it.
i wouldn't want my boyfriend to have lunch with another woman especially on valentine's day.

she does not want anyone to say anything about the situation.
send me an instant message right now on yahoo messenger. my id is pao__num_
that was similar to my situation _num_ years ago.
he says that you do not love him because you have only called him twice.
i think that a lot of things are important.
please her sexually as well.
i know quite a few decent gentlemen.
keep looking for that special person and you will find them!
even though it is acceptable, your partner does not need to know everything you think about.
it is more exciting so you're aware, being shy is a hindrance.
i used to do it frequently.
casually place it out there.
they are very untruthful.
being intimate with a friend, cab create a rift in the relationship.

no. enter reality, this is not a place to communicate freely.

if he loves her, then why not be in a relationship with her?
tell him he is the boss, or leave him to find someone else.
get to a doctor if you have not already.
whether my friends agree with this or not, i believe as a friend, i am irreplaceable.
say that you love him/her in order to surprise him/her.
he always says he is sorry, but then in a month he is lying and being dishonest.
my boyfriend is similar to a government mule when he farts and belches.
if he only likes you for what you do, try doing something that he would not like doing and see how he reacts.
if you do not tell him the truth you will always wonder .
love them, because god granted you love first.
you should think this through carefully.
i will never forget that odd moment when i fell to my knees.
play the selection 'baby, baby, stay gone,' a song by jimmy wayne.
however, i derive pleasure from heavy petting, including even a small amount of stroking.
in the first place, do not do anything unless you want to do it.
i married an attractive, rude man and i later divorced him.

the waves to not normally get that big when it is raining.
you've become uninterested in engaging with him personally.
no, not in actuality. however, if you become impregnated, your baby may be born deceased or suffer deformities and/or illness upon birth.
showing her should cause fewer fights than hiding things.
do not go on another date with her.
if women are not attracted to you because of it. is their own problem.
what will i do with the two of them?
was his boss mean to him?
if you look straight into his eyes, you will get an answer.
just like other men, i too like women younger.
if he needs to kill himself to get over this then so be it.
then, he attempted suicide, and my unintelligent self went to see him in the hospital.
post script, i am not criticizing or labeling you.
do not let sex ruin anything.

be married if that is what you want.
you had an intimate interlude with her, she is the boss, and that is just that.
i believe he didn't, because he feels terrible.
he is a jerk, but he says he wants to be with me.

congratulations to the bride and groom, she is a lucky girl!
you are, however, too good for her in any event.
transmit a video recording of you having sexual relations; it's lucrative.
her appearance would not matter.

do you have a desire to be criticized as unintelligent?
i want to try something a little more exciting.

do not take life seriosuly, you are young.
they have a hard face.
true love will fin you anywhere as long as you're honest.

the rest is simply cosmetic.
find someone that you deserve.
i have been socializing with a very attractive man and our relationship is progressing positively everyday.
i very much love my former lover.
furthmore, avoid the plants that i mentioned.
if she is attracted to you, that would be great.
if your reason is because you have affections for some one else, then communicate that.
how is it wrong to discriminate based on sexual orientation.

until that time, stop being so inconsiderate.
it is every man's dream when she says it does not mean anything.
also, you should behave very respectfully in relation to it, as well.
are you perhaps sending an inappropiate message?
you need to let it go, and move on.

if she asks me, i do not know the answer.
what's the reason for your unemployment?
i like him alot.

if you do inspire her to impress you, then you do not look the same to her.
when i look back on it, i am not too sure why i did that in the first place!
i am not asking him on a date or anything similar.
it is too much risk if you are asking for my opinion.
if you are truly interested in the answer, just ask her.
what use is a nice appearance if he is rude?
ask him if he would like to go on a date with you.
this is our only issue; we get along great otherwise.
from where do you obtain these statistics?
if no one that you like asks you for a date, then just refuse.
it probably is discomforting for him.
i am intelligent, but i do not think i am intelligent enough for him.

there is no problem if you agree with him; however, what are your feelings in this regard?
get one as thick as you want.
she has a constant fear.
look for younger men even though some fifty year old men are good looking.
what is the opposite of being above me?
it's not something that males like to do.
why can you not simply ask her on a date?
she simply is my true love even if she is not considered special by others.
have you ever heard of a pajama party?
do you really enjoy hurting people who are so important to you?
my friend often teases me because of my personality.
no, move on with your life. i have been through this before.
a lot of guys dream about the same thing.
it is not a good idea to date everyone.
i have the same problem.
karma will rear its head on him again.

this question is for women especially: have you ever been in a relationship with a man who you did not know well?
oh, indeed, if you genuinely feel compelled to do so...deliver one to him, as well.
i guess it makes for quick access.
however females are less concerned, compared to males, at least.
or simply enthused regarding their romantic relationship?
i recommend handing them a toilet brush.
there is no need to keep playing immature games.
that is not typical for a man.
i would probably break up with him for that.

i do not want to be a burden.
however, don't forget that entertaining the opposite sex isn't necessarily defined as a romantic relationship.
it depends on the man because it is not all guy.
a sense of humor is important.
please repeat after me. you are a dishonest jerk.

i don't agree that woman should approach first.
perhaps you should both take s hot bath.

stop trying to control her life.
my man tells me it gives him the opportunity to tell me that i am attractive.
you should stop and think about how that makes you look in front of his friends.
it does not matter who she was, even if it was a stripper.
i feel that they should get married at this time.
the one you think is your boyfriend is not a real boyfriend.
i love only worrying about myself.
is there something wrong?
oh, also were men aware of your comment, you'd be severely unpopular, for your edification.
tell him all relevant information.
be careful if he is the kind of human who has trouble understanding.
oh, yes, there must be a great sense of humor, self-confidence, and a kind nature.
i would not want to the seventh man if she starts to think about the eighth.
he is sweet, but does not always think correctly.
select me, however, provide a bit more specificity regarding category or stereo. in other words, age is also a consideration!
why is she interested in being a spectator?
i don't like hurting people.
she deserves credit for sticking with it even when she finds it upsetting.
my boyfriend, who i have been dating for just over a year, has lied to me continuously throughout our entire relationship.
did he do it on purpose?
you can trust us, because you would know if we lie.
ask her why she is in a relationship as well as her feelings towards you.
the reason is that they usually enjoy making you feel bad.
the answer to your query, is that men are incomprehensible.
i am in love with my child's father, whom is also my boyfriend!
you have obviously made your decision about being sexually active with him.
i wish they would treat us with respect.
of course that made me extremely angry.
are you suppose to sign that?
it is a narrow way of thinking that god does not care about sexual proclivities.
a nice wedding in the yard was good enough for me.
although, i am glad that i had married him, people are freaking out about that.
just in the event your heart is desirous of it; if your instinct is to flee, proceed to behave thusly.
someone who is unfaithful once will be unfaithful again.
you should wait until you hear what she has to say.
maybe he believes that it is your fault that you are a parent.
i do not want to offend any good men in the world.
i am unaware of that specifically.
do not encourage your girlfriend to become an exotic dancer.
my best friend went on a date with a very short man and they even kissed each other.
a sign that he is not cheating, is if his answer is yes.
she's fond of you as she would be of a sibling.
why would i be rifling through his belongings, if i did?
he is not lonely.
no, that means that you are the girl of my dreams.
terminate your relationship with him.
i hear a coat vacuum will take care of it.
break up with him and do not listen to his excuses because he does not love you.
you notice her appearance and nothing else.
you will never have contact with him if you do not reach out to him now.
it can be exciting to be bad once in awhile, especially if you are good all the time.
we also possess hormonal systems, for your information!
no, unless you have some doubt about that.
honey, i love you with all my heart.
there are better things you an do with your life then try to understand men.
you need to relax for awhile.
sometimes i travel back to my hometown to get away. my hometown is located across the country from where he is.
be sexually intimate before you go to sleep.
say yes if you are interested in him and no if you are not.
if i had to choose, i would choose african american, because caucasian men just do not attract me.
that depends on whether he prefer war games, sports games, et cetera.
i no longer want to be in a relationship with him.
they are loved because if they were not then they would not find it.
i played over half the game because they coaches were more laid back.
their way of thinking is merely different from yours.
it can help your relationship.
keep playing the game untill you get to level _num_
maybe i can help since i speak the language of idiots, grunts, and jabberwockys.
you can travel to the uk and find the answer.
most of the woman on campus really don't like him.
men like to stare at our breasts.
break up with the girlfriend you have. she would be shocked.
speak up for yourself.
you can give her a nice gift, and ask her then.
how can i respond if i do not know your gender?
do not worry and be mean about it because love is not rare.
she should make a decision, so she can prevent getting pregnant.
if he is cheating, then you need to make him leave.
begin from your wedding day.
i have many male friends, but also many female friends.
the future is not bright.
if you are worried about the lack of commitment, have a conversation about it first.
i do not liek wearing flat shoes, and i will not change that for a guy.
if he loves you, it will break his heart, however he will survive.
why did you marry him knowing he is not talkative and you know you want him to talk to you?
i see it everythere online.
do not sleep together if you have not already.
what kind of father does that make him?
spend time with a man who has some rough edges.
the problem is, i am not sure if she feels the same for me.
i do not like emotionally weak people, though.
the meaning is she is fond of you in a brotherly fashion.
that is only effective in bad teenager movies.
there was not enough feelings there for her that he would leave his wife.
stay with your sister if need be.
i found that it is best to go out with a friend.
do you think that he is interested in me or is just playing games?
i don't like the language they are using.
i do not know how to deny someone and still be friends with them.
certain persons enjoy 'snuggling,' others not so much.
i invited her over, we went inside my room, and i closed the door.
it is fun and for romantic love.
have you seen the motion picture 'the game?'
be sure not to profess your love too early in the relationship.
i would like to be done with work.
it takes time to remember the good times and forget the bad.
i saw them last year, and they were very good.
she is not even in college yet and the two of you would like to have a serious relationship?
you could e-mail him if you cannot do that.
you begin to want her more if you think about her more often.
i occasionally think only about coitus.
it ought to be elaborate, public, and demonstrate her importance to you. you should attempt it.
that will make it worse.
maybe you thought there was more love then there was when you got married.
when someone hurts you, then you will have someone else to fall back on.
tell her to try to ask him to go out with her or something.
i believe he is seeing a non-respectable woman.
if she will not remain faithful to you, she is not worth it.
if you liek him, you should go on a date with him.
she cannot hinder you from visiting with your child.
no man would bribe you to kill your child.
you should stop calling and see if he misses you.
reprimand your daughter for her bad behavior.
it may have been communicated in the same manner as you informed us.
if i did not have children, i would die for the one i love.
why do so many men want to live with asian women?
help me answer the question what needs to be done.
go out with one of her closest friends, and treat her like a queen.
tell her to not date bad guys.
a lot of my friends' girlfriends have asked me a similar question.
i am trying to solve that problem myself.
try to kiss him to see if you have any feelings for him?
my boyfriend truly enjoys my toes.
you need to do it before he leaves ot when you see him next.
i am a man and recommend that you proceed slowly and steadily.
are you listening to yourself?
basically lead him by saying what you want.
he can not get a girl to share.
you become disinterested easily when you are with him or her.
you know what you have to do.
my toy is predicting a
well, one particular afternoon, i had him take a seat and i informed him of my romantic feelings.
she questioned me regarding my sensitivities.
well it all depends on how long you have been with her.
you might have tried to do or be that if you knew.
you are in trouble.
when she is free and has the desire to do so, she will.
that shouldn't be a problem.
the gown and the bridesmaids' dresses could take you a month to choose on their own!
things started to change later that month.
it is not okay and just because he is male does not make it right.
i would choose jamookae. he has serious mental problems.
i was wondering about how to kiss her the next time.
i am just stating my opinion!
i am not one of them.
what is the point of killing an innocent baby?
she does not like you romantically.
try to be kind, relaxed, calm, and let her know you like her.
it was not meant to be if they do not come after you.
perform the second step if you see no results after three weeks.
in the vast majority of cases, he is not comfortable wearing the outfits that you like on him.
however, i'm not the person who committed any forbidden acts. i adore him so intensely, what steps should i take?
don't forget, a man merely being aware of your involvement is no indicator that he won't still make an attempt.
roses have a singularly reddish hue, violets sport a bluish coloring.
do what you have to do because it is not wrong.
his wife may be less seductive now than she has been in the past.
yes, i care, but it is not the most important aspect.
think nothing of it, he will understand.
you elope with the person you can't stand to live without.
yes, you should move on and attempt to find a new relationship. there are plenty of single people out there.
you basically have to overdose in order to feel anything.
if one did not enjoy using intimate toys, than apparently it did not help them.
apologies, it's will remain forever uncomfortable and somewhat oddball-ish.
how do i get it to come out?
i would help her if i knew who she was.
not merely honest, but also honorable. i do not commit infidelity or pretend to care.
i appreciate school instructors. however, i am not employed as such.
i have had boyfriends enough though i wear glasses.
if i met the woman for whom i have been searching, then she would be all i need.
that was after i caught him cheating.
do not make yourself seem cheep. married men are not avaliable!
i enjoy dreaming of different men, which i suppose is acceptable.
tell him when you are in private at the right moment.
thirty is relatively young to be getting heavier.
stand your ground, and let him know it is over.
your age is too low and an excess of negative events can result.
he is done with you because he got what he wanted.
look at the barns if it not at the pet stores.
if you have already found another, then free him from your life so he can find another girl.
i would be with you if i knew.
i don't know you well enough to be in love with you.
it is too late, you've lost your chance with her.
i think she preoccupied and won't notice if someone else likes her.
so, you say that you are attracted to a lesbian but you are not a lesbian yourself. that does not make any sense.
i will talk to you later about this.
show him what you like, instead of telling him.
mosy guys would liek a chance if you are not married.
in the event your age is below _num_ years, you are saddled with an enormous difficulty.
perhaps that's simply his identity.
i adore sexual intercourse, as well, and am unable to become satiated.
date him on a single occasion and, should you have enjoyed the encounter, then, don't be stupid, maintain his company.
politely ask why you haven't heard from her for some time.
first - get divorced, second - prove her true character, and then you're finished.
their favorite position is your money in their hands.
it isn't wrong, just do what you have to.
if you would like to, you can have intercourse.
she thinks of you as no more than a friend.
yes, it is the french that everyone was using, but this works as well.
but remember that dating does not have to mean being boyfriend and girlfriend.
everyone wants a "perfect" person but no one seems to be willing to be one.
just act as if she if one of your friends.
if he says, "good-bye," to you, then it was not meant to be.
women do not care as much about it as men do.
i am with this other girl. i have already met her parents and they really like me.
i would be with you if i knew.
talk to him. do not waste time.
if being apart makes them happy, then you should be happy for them.
what would be a good gift for a girl that i like?
you will get asked out.
do not do somethign that you will regret later.
he is giving you bad advice.
do not fall for it again.
no, i do not think that anything happened, it was not a real-life situation.
well, that too, in the same house, where he is living right now, ubder angelina's nose, cool right?!
sounds a little but suspicious to me, do you think that she has something to hide.
wear a sexy outfit, and then get yourself all dolled up for him, and make his favorite dinner, then end the night with some kinky sex!
on occasion, you're unable to travel to your birthplace once and for all.
just make sure that you are not going overboard with it.
it is certainly oxygen, as you cannot live without oxygen.
girls, have you ever gone out with a guy that you really liked, but did not really know?
take some time to learn to use oxygen, if you do not know how to already.
that would depend if you are a guy or a girl.
you are strong, and that will make him weak.
make her believe that you do not think about her at all.
if you are already having intercourse with the man, then the best thing to do is have more.
i can lend you a few.
start by kissing, then gradually become more passionate.
both of you need freedom from the relationship to receive closure and continue forward.
you should tell her how you feel.
i would only get upset if i found the man unattractive.
why does she want to take a glance?
we are terrible liars, men are better liars.
people have eloped in jail.
think of how they are feeling.
they will always be that way!
i have a labrador and love him a lot!
dreams do not mean it is going to happen.
what an eye opener that was for me.
it is not true. she lies about boys liking her.
you do not have to ask her to be your girlfriend.
she cares for you like a brother.
i want only one.
keep searching for that special someone.
is it a long distance?
that's how i envision it.
they have to be in the mood for love.
don't worry about fickle things.
what about trusting people when things get tough.
you should have someone else tell him for you.
roses are red, and violets are blue.
if you like him, say yes, if you do not, say no.
we have hormones, also.
we are both _num_ years old. i am a it low on funds. he likes chocolates, yet are not chocolates too platitudinous?
if you do not know, then i will not tell you.
sounds like he might have found another way to please himself.
if it hurts, then it is too long.
be yourself and just see what happens.
that poppycock. perhaps you simply have personal issues concerning asian females.
the meaning is she is fond of you in a brotherly fashion.
is what you're referring to the concept of time or the longitudinal reading?
no, not in actuality. however, if you become impregnated, your baby may be born deceased or suffer deformities and/or illness upon birth.
of course, it is the feelings that matter.
do not give him want he wants so easily, because it will give him too much control faster than what you want.
i prefer a man who is not afraid to show that he is sensitive on the inside.
i had the pleasure of reading what you received, but thank you for the information.
i married the sister of my high school sweetheart.
your partner should be your best friend.
if there is no commitment, you two should talk first.
i do not have her wait for me.
please dream of me, then date me.
do not have sex with him for awhile.
do not go out with her again.
if he wants a break you are either boring, or he is having sex with someone else.
find someone who wants their future with you.
this wedding is not about you.
hope this answer helps you.
i want to get back with him.
at that point, determine if he desires to continue being together.
well, in this situation, i'm similar to your female friend, you're akin to my spouse!
what's the reason you're not willing to let nonsense increase?
well, give it a second thought. your desire is not to endanger a quality relationship!
to the extent that females lacking a g-spot are able to experience sex that's agreeable.
is he not a good person?
i have learned things on here that i did not know about before.
you have to protect yourself, and keep yourself covered.
i am outside your window.
why would you ask me that question?
i am curious if any women have advice about having intercourse for the first time.
listen to your intellect and emotions.
perhaps because you are older than you say. you gave me a negative answer, so here is yours.
online conversation invitations are dangerous. meet people in reality.
you have to ask.
can you help me find something unique and not too expensive?
you do not have to pay state and federal grants back.
i am in my mid-_num_ and i am still a virgin.
did did not know that untill now.
because men are so great at it that we do not compare.
most men try to act ignorant around the women they are attracted to.
it means that they love you, and want you back.
only girls must reply to this question, please!
i agree with exclusive. you should pull yourself together!
sexual intercourse is sexual intercourse, and is no big deal.
only if she is twice your age.
you do not. what are you doing, asking a question like that?
unless they want it just as much as you do.
if you feel that he is, then chances are he is.
come to henderson, north carolina as there are enough of them here.
try the planet earth as i hear there are a lot of girls there!
first get soaked in the rain and then ask your man to carry you so you can get cozy.
ask him where he sees his life going.
try wall street, as in stocks, etc.
you never have to ask. look him in the eye, see through to his thoughts and you will know.
touching is very important. it does not have the same limitations as languages and it carries enough warmth to make a person happier.
then jon inquired if i would become jealous if spent time with another woman named alyssa.
how could i be paid by using a service available on the internet?
it will hinder your ability to do amusing things with people.
do not fear, you will most likely mature and think differently.
why is he your boyfriend?
it depends on the size of his penis.
i want to try and spice things up.
yes, if i was trying to get out of the relationship.
you need to be loyal, nice, friendly, and sweet.
your story could be in a television series.
who could i possibly answer if i do not even know if you are a male or a female.
we all control our own lives, but, unfortunately, we do not practice that enough, we search outward for the answers.
attempt at raising yourself as he is not obliged to feed you.
and then, if you have not already, have a doctor examine you.
he will get jealous and when he does inform him that you feel the same way.
we can discuss this situation later.
it is interesting that you like this girl.
it is important so they know how many quests to expect.
what does that mean?
then do not go back for him.
it did in my thoughts.
i do not know how i will stop caring about him.
that is only effective in bad teenager movies.
who is more important to you?
you are answering your own question.
do not do it during your period.
if he will not sit with you, then that is just friendship.
we have hat a lot of in and outs.
i feel like we have so much time together, to break up now would be stupid.
how can i stop being a jealous girlfriend?
what goes on in a mans head?
i need your help with this and i guess you need a guys perspective?
if you have to ask, then you already know the answer.
would you date a girl who takes off her clothes while dancing for a living?
you will see it is much better.
if you send a video of yourself having sex, you can get paid for it.
why not tell her the truth?
you can go as far as you want to go.
if you live near me, i will take you on a date.
he is not interested.
invite him to spend time with you and then make advances and observe how he responds.
i need many answers so please attempt this.
sex with my sexy man (and i did not have to share him).
i would say that you are the one and only.
i say no way unless your best friend is suggesting this to you.
if you do not live in the miami area you should get here fast because this is the best place.
tell her how much you love her.
i became close with this guy.
are you sending the wrong message?
just don't say you are a virgin.
i love not having to worry about any body.
i don't like big boobs.
that is interesting. i still have a long way to go, but thank you for these two points.
honesty is one of the things which contributes to love.
when he knows that i am not looking, he will stare at a woman and examine her.
i would probably break up with him.
women want a challenge. not a man who they can easily control.
it is because no one has done it to them, so they do not know how it feels.
we are better liars than men.
are there men who you like but you do not date?
if you are not hiding information, then showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
my problem is that i always see others the way i want to see them.
go on many dates with different men in order to forget him.
"i know he is rude, but he says he wants to be with me."
leave him, you're wasting your time if you stay with him.
if a person won't be honest with you, then you should just forget them.
it will remain a mystery to everyone.
i promise to not bring my friends along with me.
she knew i was present and in love with her.
if you approach slowly, her body language will tell you what you need to know.
it does not mean he does not love you.
i have a crush on a man and i know that he likes me too.
yes, the dark hair and eyes and skin; and they are said to have nice bottoms also.
either he is extremely busy or he is not a good man.
spend some time with him on a few occasions and discover what he is like.
the waves in boracay do not typically get that large even though it is raining.
they are merely dreams, you must know.
and will i always have to struggle to meet my needs?
proceed slowly and attempt to make it perfectly.
because their thinking is not clear.
no, i know jim, he is.
don't you just love it when a man acts like that!
a dinner date on a cruise ship, amazing!
if you really like him and want to spend your life with him, then don't have sex just because you are aroused.
if that does not work then talk to a friend. not about him though!
do you have a picture page or something?
honestly, i like men that have not been with a lot of other women.
are are an awful person.
they are not playing sexual games.
it was a different time, with different ladies.
that depends on your relationship.
if you love them, they will love you back.
i think he will cheat on you some time.
trust me, i know relationships.
i still think about him.
pretend he is not there.
no, but who is truly happy, anyway?
it is easy to say yes, but i have a feeling it would be tough to do.
you do not need to worry about that.
there is no way that is the issue.
i would be suspicious of him being unfaithful.
girls do not like it when a guy is a show-off.
i realize that my mom and dad are happy being apart.
how do i get it to come out?
love is a weird thing for guys.
whatever, he is a dolt anyway.
if it does not mean anything, then why is she going out with another girl?
you can do this, but please do not do it, you deserve more.
asian women are similar to wiser, more mature women.
let her know that it bothers you. if she does not stop, run!
i will say wait until she is ready to wear a bra.
i prefer a friend to whom i can talk to.
you need to make him believe you have interest in his best friend.
you should send your ex a valentines' day gift.
it is not over until the fat lady sings.
click on my avatar and examine my questions. they are nearly identical.
do not say that because most men are not of low intelligence.
you are causing me to feel as if i had just taken two benadryl.
and does it make any difference if you are shy?
if i were rejected for it, i would deserve it.
that does not mean he doesn't care for you!
most people who kiss badly do so because they don't truly know themselves.
no, you need to move on. i have been in your shoes before.
always trust your instincts. do you still doubt him?
dark hair, dark eyes, and olive skin.
if he is attractive and you really like him i would, but that is just my opinion and for you to decide.
i only care about what type of person she is now.
it is too much risk if you are asking for my opinion.
when the pain from the love consumes something or someone perhaps.
just contact me and we will talk about this one.
guaranteed that there is someone likes her and she is missing it because she is obsessed with the other guy.
i am not sure where it is. if you find it, let me know, because i really want it back.
they do not want to be your friend any longer?
dear, it is not a good idea until when and if you get the perfect partner.
did you ask him what lead him to cheat?
that is too much skin for my taste!
even now, all of their stuff is untrue.
then distract her and leave!
invite him for dinner or a movie!
love them because god gave you love first.
you can learn from this.
that is the same reason most women dolts.
learn how to spell so i can understand what you're asking.
find someone that you deserve.
you need to be careful.
what matters is how long and how thick.
try a card, and if you cannot, simply say "i love you."
...or something he would like to see you wear. then, go back to the store and buy it.
do not force it. you may make a mistake if you do.
why would she miss someone, who was not hers to begin with?
my breasts are too big, so no.
i notice it often online. i was merely wondering.
it is not very attractive, in my opinion.
discuss this before you make a worse mistake.
approach her and tell her that you are the man for whom she has been waiting all her life.
how old are you? also, i would like to be your friend.
yes, get out of there quickly.
they do not think the way that you do.
just move on with your life and find someone else to love.
i think that you have a boyfriend.
the one that i had with your mother.
do any other females feel the same way?
do you mean, how many minutes into the first date?
i am intersted in him, however, i do not know that he is intersted in me.
at times is does not matter how you use it.
what type of friend are you searching for?
how much do you testes perspire?
lately he avoids me and will not talk to me.
dance for him in something seductive.
i admire young women with pleasant demeanors.
i appreciate school instructors. however, i am not employed as such.
he acts like he still does.
it depends how far you would let me go.
he obviously is trying to hit on another girl.
and have a joyous happy valentines day!
i am always happy waking up this morning, i am at work now.
have i told you lately that you are beautiful? !
just keep your head held high, and do not give up hope of things are not working out in your favor!y
there are some good country mannered men out there that would love to have a good ol' country girl!
ask her out on a casual date.
do not encourage your girlfriend to become a stripper.
that description certainly screams flirting!
yes my boyfriend is crazy about my toes!
if you love someone then you sacrifice being with anyone else.
good luck, and have a good day!
i had intercourse with a man who worked very hard.
do you think that he is interested in me or is just playing games?
you love someone for who they are, not for the color of their skin.
there is not supposed to be any false love, so i suppose "true love" is merely a euphemism.
if you only want your ex, then leave the rest of them alone.
there is no need to keep playing immature games.
you are probably so very unattractive, that he has no choice but to look.
just go and talk to her and ask her out for a bite to eat or something like that.
if she likes you as a person, then great.
come on, yes, it is okay now.
ask if they would like to hang out.
do not insult them because they like you.
maybe he thinks it is your fault you have a child.
i think that might be too soon to tell for certain.
there must be a reason for her jealousy.
i suggest showing him what this is like, firsthand.
seek me out if you'd like to have fun!
he has to see you as beautiful at night too.
i am sure you are beautiful as well, don't be jealous just have fun.
don't listen to those girls.
this question was hilarious.
you are a sad person.
you can ask him why.
what is it was a guy?
it is not going to last, so go out and have fun.
do not ask him out. make him ask you out.
perhaps because you are different from everyone else.
the best way is to look him in the eye. then you will receive the answer.
besides, do we really want our mothers to be liars?
tell him in a form which he would appreciate (we all have a way). discover what his is and use it.
do you truly want to spend the rest of your life with someone who behaves that way?
every time i talk about it, he says that i am being overbearing.
i would believe that he is having intercourse with someone else.
i occasionally return to my hometown in order to be away from him.
remember that this man also needs to help pay your expenses.
simply laugh out loud and you should feel better.
he is a man, what do you expect?
it could be. it sounds as though he enjoys being around you. you never know.
why does race matter?
stop doting on yourself and attend the wedding.
my e-mail address is _num_@yahoo.com. i like new friends.
if an african american breaks into my house, then is it fair to say most african americans are criminals?
do not be a weak, cowardly degenerate.
i like for the woman to be loud, though.
if he has money and is not strange, then remain.
be unfaithful towards you, then write a note.
if you ask him, he will most likely be honest.
enjoy your life. do not allow him to slow your progress.
the man to whom you are conversing is a psychopath and is trying to control you.
the next day i went with my boyfriend to eat at the restaurant to which we were going.
there are no men in this town worth dating.
i want her to be interested in me.
you should not think that way because it can give everyone the impression that you are unintelligent.
did his boss give him a difficult time?
she has a constant fear.
beautiful girls are everywhere. you should look around you.
distance makes lies harder to hide.
i expect he will go to jail even though it was mutual.
commercials will say that condoms do not always protect, but using one is better than nothing!
it is a different one each weak, but check for the signs like eye contact and flirting.
should i break up with her, or roll with the punches, and trust that she really cares for me?
do not ever go to places that you used to hang out at a lot.
do you thing i should go back there, or should i stay home?
you do not have to feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down, life is too short to let things worry you.
yes, you love him but, you do not want to risk him giving you something that he has brought back.
most guys are not really short-sighted, you are just meeting the wrong people.
i think it is a big myth that men are just large, mentally challenged, coitus barbarian.
even though your thoughts are okay, your partner need not know everything you think about.
of course, unless it was a good dream.
if he wants to be friends, then it is best to move forward.
what one gives out will come back to them.
of course, it depends on the man.
it is simple. buy a flower for him and tell him that you love him.
tell her goodbye, life is too short.
you know, we do it as well!
they boy is fourteen to sixteen years-old and he likes me.
if you decide to go for it, have fun!
if a man does not want a relationship with you, there is not much you can do about it.
do whatever makes you happy
it depends on the girl i guess, but i lie constantly and i get away with it.
imagination is the key because you only get what you can imagine.
it is not a good idea to date everyone.
have you ever heard of a pajama party?
guys do like it when a woman has a broad vocabulary, or at least are not too busy to look words up.
riza, if you do not know the reason, then why answer? it could be a strange person.
i have been there. the place is very good.
attempt to ignore the man and it will be forgotten eventually.
to answer your question: no, there is no way to understand men.
merely wanting to meet friends in amsterdam.
she acts like she is doesn't enjoy it, so should i date her or let her be?
you need to take it slow, no one likes to hear that they are not a good kisser.
it is like asking if love has ever existed, not everyone is bad.
do you have schizophrenia?
what question do you enjoy?
do exciting activities, such as covering yourselves in whipped cream or some other delicious food.
do not merely wait for something good to occur.
what do you do if he is very attractive?
threaten him by saying you will contact the police if he does not pay child support.
without regard to whether or not they chuckle on the occasion.
i have no certainty as to my course of action.
initially, his comment in and of itself merely demonstrates the true extent of his character.
should it be due to your affection for another, communicate the fact.
they are unwise and mean, they are going to have to learn the hard way.
i guess it makes for quick access.
he has got way too many girl friends, help me, i'm confused.
i say right on to being a virgin, it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
you can stop trying to control her life.
why would a man want a relationship with a cold individual such as you are?
i am simply trying to avoid quarrels because she becomes jealous easily.
some men are made uneasy by marriage and other commitments, and a discussion might be effective.
i would like men to explain whether they would, or would not, date a virgin.
they have no smarts. that is why their head hurts.
why do men fantasize about an asian girl?
it depends if you want an emotional attachment.
do what you want to do.
once someone is a cheater, they always are cheaters.
if you are lonely you can talk to me.
you will say "you can't hurt me anymore" when you are angry.
in all honesty, that is attractive all on its own.
find someone who is as mature as you are.
i would not be attracted to her in the first place.
it is healthy and natural, but if you are not careful you can get some horrible viruses!
take a good look in the mirror.
he got what he wanted and now he wants nothing to do with you.
most men, as you may know, are aroused all the time.
i would also question how much of a friend your best friend is.
if you are considering taking him back, do not.
send him a message from your mobile phone.
god moves in many ways.
when you are at least _num_
he loves you because you are his lady.
i had the same problem. look at the answers i recieved.
this is your time and your life.
he will understand and not be bothered by it.
i hope this helps.
please try to remember this, the leading cause of divorce is getting married.
if he is not able to reciprocate, then do not let him finish the job.
i wish you had no problems fornicating.
yes, i did, and it was awful.
you cannot force yourself onto anyone or you will have no one.
if you are not improving and enjoying yourselves, then the relationship is over.
i also have that problem, but if you are good at sexual intercourse, i am sure she will not notice.
give her things that are meaningful.
it depends upon how old you are.
having younger friends can help you think and feel younger.
tell the awful woman that you hate her and she needs to back off.
i do not think the husband deserved to have it!
in live, you get that for which you pay.
yes it is possible; in fact, it happens to me frequently.
no, i am a girl and i only think about sex if i am really in love with someone.
if he is cheating, then you need to make him leave.
also, if you do not think of anything else, consider any sexually transmitted diseases that he might bring home to you.
no, there is not a way in which girls will every understand boys.
you need to have fun while you are young.
i heard you are getting married soon, when is it?
honesty is the best policy, it always works for me.
you blew the chances of him asking you out.
i absolutely love all italian women!
i am still trying to figure that one out myself.
if she is really unattractive, having intercourse won't be worth it.
why do the more exciting sports have lots of physical contact?
when you have moved on, you won't care if he moves on.
that is not typical for a man.
most women talk about it, they have sex toy gatherings.
although, the situation didn't conclude very positively.
weigh the pros and cons prior to doing so. as a result, you'll avoid speaking incorrectly.
accomplish the task once you've become betrothed.
she accomplishes it once more, feel ashamed.
all right, therefore approximately three months past, everything commenced with some flirtation.
you should go out with your friends and meet new people.
he will accidentally run into you while you are out and about.
if she is a romantic, buy her flowers and chocolate, even though valentine's day is over.
i do not know about you, but i do not like the bad-boy type.
fun songs are always the way to go.
introduce him to a friend.
i married someone that i met at a strip club.
i want it more then guys.
their brains are younger then ours.
he and i met through his brother's friend.
you should think it through very well.
yes, they are, and i am not one of them.
hello, how are you? what do you mean? i want a friend in amsterdam. please send me the information. sincerely, shaba.
i am not at all prudish. i enjoy oral intercourse and pornography, i am also attractive.
as with men not understanding women, most of the time.
your best friend is not a friend if he had intercourse with your girlfriend.
i do not know. perhaps i am simply incapable of lying too much.
the least she could say is "no."
i contemplate sexual activity constantly, and to a greater extent than every male friend.
it causes feelings of sadness and negativity. all right, farewell.
it's woeful, the way in which certain persons behave.
play the selection "baby, baby, stay gone," a song by jimmy wayne.
i don't even talk to other guys.
if that doesn't work, i have no other advice to offer.
if she is already in a relationship, you will have to set your sights on someone else.
it's simple--back up everything you say to her.
it does not fit in the mouth.
if he does not like you kids, break up. because family comes first.
you can tell by the way they look and talk to you.
i have been to a few concerts.
i would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you.
your future is not bright; it will lead to death.
what are the indications of a man who is flirting?
what is the point of killing an innocent baby?
your guess is as good as mine.
well mine is _num_ to _num_ inches.
remember bill gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
strike _num_, he doesn't like kids.
best friends are always more important than women.
a woman who loves and cares about him.
do not run, he is merely talking.
keep it, he may be a great man, who wants to be friend.
if he says no, he won't be useful.
ignore rumors that people start.
if you find out the answer, please contact me.
i am only trying to be just.
man, i hate to have to say this, but, she was cheating on you with this guy before you guys broke up.
i invited her over, and we went into my bedroom, and i shut the door.
there is this really handsome guy in my neighborhood.
i am a gemini actually, but honestly speaking, i do not believe in horoscopes.
it is the only thing true ladies are serious about.
instead of a young woman, you should procure a young man for your own liking.
however, i enjoy physical affection.
i really do not think much about it.
do not say too much.
hold you head up, and smile.
my advice is to avoid feeling regret.
is is acceptable for me to have sex with my girlfriend?
if you have a baby, there is someone who fathered it.
i went to clubs simply to have a fun evening.
if that is your answer, yes they can say they won't cheat.
would you have intercourse with more than one person at once?
i don't believe that would be at all useful.
what if you're interested in someone, but are not sure if they have the same feelings towards you?
what should you do if your boyfriend hasn't called or messaged you in three weeks?
if you have to ask, however, you are probably too young or immature to get married at this time.
the answer is "yes" because nearly all men are like that.
the decision is entirely up to you but don't spend too much time looking.
it does not mean good things for you in terms of dating her.
my male friends tell me that confidence, but not arrogance, is sexy.
either you call her or you are going to have to work really hard to earn some money and buy a car.
did you sleep with his brother or his best friend?
you could spread rumors about her where you are.
do not send an instant message, that says age, gender, and location.
i am telling you from personal experience.
women do not speak of it, a lot.
she did it once. shame on her.
it can help your relationship.
so, tell the truth and see where it takes you.
i saw them last year. they were doing great.
do you want someone that does not know what he wants?
you should let her try a sports' bra on.
you should tell her you love her and attempt to find money.
you know you were thinking it.
i do not know you in order to love you.
you should not be having sex in the first place.
you get bored when you are with them.
if you trust him, you should not worry.
you know what you have to do.
if you know he is cheating, you need to dump him.
if he or she truly made you happy, you would be glad to say back off and not flirt.
as good as it may sound, do not do anything for valentine's day.
homosexual men enjoy listening to them.
if he did call, it was at least once per week.
most men are not unintelligent, you simply associate with unintelligent men.
it is not okay and just because he is male does not make it right.
it depends on the mood of my wife is in at the time.
do not do it if you are looking for advice.
do not do anything that you do not want to do.
does he not trust me?
you are young, and should speak with your mother about that subject.
my apologies; it will continue to be awkward and strange.
i simply am looking for some enjoyable love songs, although it may be somewhat saccharine.
divorce is not something that children enjoy.
inform her that there is something you have been wanting to tell her.
i cannot believe he is telling you.
i believe that being with someone is best.
this is the first time i have ever had to do something like this for someone; can you please help me?
you should keep it that way regardless of how angry she becomes.
that is a stupid question to ask and if you do not know, you never will know.
i do not live there so i am sorry but i could not tell you.
ask her why she is in the relationship, and how she feels about you.
i like the doggystyle position.
they like sexual positions such as being on top, bending over, or doggystyle.
follow your emotions. what feels right to you?
do not allow another woman to have a chance with the person in whom you are interested.
love without intercourse and intercourse after marriage is the best.
if i keep thinking about the man in whom i am interested, i focus on my work or read a book.
that is a good question, i am a girl, so i will never know.
that has to be the worst actions to take toward your friends.
if you have feelings for his friend instead, you should tell him.
i hope you meet some friends soon.
yes, if you have to ask.
are you wanting to get married?
sex is like air and water.
do not give him too many chances.
it is okay if you like her.
i know he loves me more, because i was still a virgin on our wedding night!
i would not agree that women should attack first!
it depends on if you are a girl as well.
as a man, i know that most men are in relationships for their own gain.
try this: did the person have intercourse with their spouse before marriage?
is that a question for a man?
try searching somewhere other than where degenerates spend time.
allow him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
it depends on how old you and your mother are.
if you are asking this question, then you are most likely too young to be getting married.
be patient and listen to what she has to say.
take action slowly, and do not just leap on him.
i believe he is just not that interested in you.
i can tell you one thing, and that is if you cheated on her you need help.
you have to be confident to flirt with us. remember to be sweet as well.
don't have sex with him, see what occurs. it's great advice.
i do, however, like him.
there is no problem if you agree with him; however, what are your feelings in this regard?
the most important consideration is to enjoy yourself.
that does not, however, mean that it is over.
i know that he also would not want me to do it.
even woman cheat, you don't have to be christian.
i believe they think the same thing about girls.
it is to show someone's action and phrases from a certain individual.
he would not have cheated if he did it.
we never became a couple because i was dating his best friend matt.
in the event he actually is unfamiliar with the females, it should have no impact.
also, you should behave very respectfully in relation to it, as well.
all right, his age is between _num_ and _num_, and your age is what?
i'm unable to comprehend why i squandered a large portion of my lifetime in a relationship with a low-quality person such as yourself!
what should i try because i want to spice things up.
it takes time to develop.
tell him him right away about the phone call.
it is as you said: he is in love with another woman.
i would have intercourse with her even if she had just done so with another man.
my friends do not like him and constantly mock him.
allow your personality to show. do not pretend to be someone else, women can sense that.
it is strange that you asked because i felt that way about a woman once. i cannot explain why.
get used to men only wanting to use you.
willy, my mothers friend, lives there. you can attempt to find people on myspace. there are people everywhere.
one solution would be to grab a male whom you have never met and have sex or get married right away.
it would be enjoyable to have a picnic lunch in a beautiful, quiet and private setting.
you should be careful that you don't end up staying in that hostel.
if it is something that you enjoy, then what is the problem?
when you want to give him a bear hug every time you see him.
everything reminds me of him and what it used to be.
it's so natural, why make and issue out of it?
i just broke up with my girlfriend but it's harder to get another one. can you help me?
did he do it on purpose?
i was thinking about how i should kiss her next time.
but, i really do love this girl.
yes, as long as she is not their supervisor.
a lack of circumcision is unattractive to me.
from my experience, it depends on both of you.
if she doesn't like you enough to stay with you only, then it isn't worth it.
i am _num_ years old and around _num_ feet _num_ inches.
have a great honeymoon!
my boyfriend notices women when he is driving and tries to not make it obvious.
i hate those kinds of people, money can't buy you class.
refrain from initiating action because she'll receive her due at some future date and time.
oh, also were men aware of your comment, you'd be severely unpopular, for your edification.
existence possesses such a quality, individuals causing pain for one another.
my virginity was forsaken at _num_ years of age; i was genuinely unaware of the reason underlying the excess of hyperbole.
simply inquire if he'd object to your transmittal of those types of photographs.
no, but you should take care of it before you try to get pregnant.
if he says it's nothing, tell him that you are not stupid.
did you say for the better or worse?
anytime he says :"come here", you go right behind him.
to my best friend forever- i like cereal!
a baby can not decide if it wants to live or die
it make me feel good about myself when other men hit on and flirt with me.
one said, "i can not leave my kids." the other said, "why do you want to have coffee with me?"
where is he working and how many hours? ask him.
i think she is _num_ there is no need to rush things, though.
some guys do not like girls playing with their behinds.
women are a mystery, and men like it that way!
however, i really do love her.
i believe that he does trust you.
i like this one guy that used to be in my class.
i merely enjoy receiving advice.
is it not torture for one and arrogance for the other?
tell them that you love them and see if they tell you the same.
that is how people naturally behave. there is nothing you can do.
i am so loud that we literally received complaints from our neighbors.
one day i told him i liked him.
are you going to let me into the conversation?
eventually he will understand.
if you like this boy, you should go out with him.
could you be more specific on what type you want? age counts too.
no one can control their dreams.
have you seen the paris hilton video yet?
trust me, men do not know what is best for women.
date one of his friends, and see how he takes it.
it is every man's dream, when a woman says that it has no significance.
or, you could spend time with friends, take your mind off of him, and have fun, girl!
i do not have experience in the matter, and therefore cannot answer. i do, however, think it is possible.
i think she wants to come to america like everyone else seems to be doing. that is me.
he likely believes it is a good thing.
the admiration is not a good reason to kiss.
crying is normal, but talking may be more productive.
pregnant women tend to lose interest in that way.
talk to him and try to understand what made him act rudely.
i would likely not date a stripper.
you no longer want to see the face of that person.
he wouldn't care if he did know!
some guy was following me in a store, i ran.
they used to be friends.
i want to be myself and not scare her away.
it sounds like you are more hung up on virginity than most men would be.
tell him without having sex with him. you will not come across as being easy.
she never got over the first time.
why did you marry him if he is quiet and you want him to talk to you?
be young, and have fun, don't take life too seriously.
i'm sorry, but you need to get a job.
no if you're over _num_, no one minds you anymore.
i don't like hurting people.
he just enjoys conversing with you.
the _num_ year old already has a daddy.
i want to be with my ex boyfriend.
find some barry white songs, they work for setting the mood.
you could find a beautiful, blonde, tall girl who is not that smart.
in retrospect i am not certain why i acted in that manner.
perhaps it is because you sound quite sorry.
i believe the best way to start is to be honest and ask him what he thinks.
i have damaged jon's friendship with matt.
perhaps it was an unwise thing for him to tell you, but in any event you should not worry about it.
i liekd this guy, and he used to like me too.
the headboard thing ruined the mood, and i did not get to come.
i would give you _num_ points for that answer.
there are a lot of great suggestions.
do not start talking about kids around your parents.
i let him ask me out.
i found out that my girlfriend was biologically a boy.
she knows she has to move on, but she can't do it. does anyone have advice for her?
you answered your own question.
because they believe they're well-liked and attractive and they simply possess those qualities in regard to courting.
for most, it is silent save for when it is extremely well-done, in which case i would act loudly.
certain persons enjoy "snuggling," others not so much.
avoid being idiotic, as i have seemed.
however, i'm not the person who committed any forbidden acts. i adore him so intensely, what steps should i take?
it is not the only things that is true.
jon and i used to be close, and talk frequently.
did he tell you he was not interested?
then i started smoking and drinking.
why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that kind of way?
if girls don't like you for that, they have problems.
can't he get rid of a girl to share hers with him?
my advise for you is don't go out with a stranger.
do you really want him back in your life?
you have to go to iraq, but keep in touch.
there are times that i think only about sex.
should you be able to know when a girl likes you?
they just want to beloved.
you should refuse to get together with her if she has been drinking.
he told me that they do not mean anything to him.
i think you only have lust for him.
also, tell him about your bad experience with someone who tried things that made you mad.
no, i am being serious, do not get him another dog.
for me, a girl that is mature.
was i not attractive to him that night?
he doesn't love you. break off the relationship, and don't listen to his excuses.
i would work with him some more.
accept this as truth, darling, individuals are sometimes different than they initially present themselves.
you're unable to prevent it from continuing. it's akin to reflexive action and we are simply inclined.
in my singular opinion, i do not prefer artificial breasts.
life is like a roller coaster; you need to adapt to it.
your boyfriend is not your boyfriend.
i began liking someone new when they asked me out so just ask.
can i get custody even though he has been a stay-at-home dad?
men want women to be ladies in public and loose women in the bedroom.
have oral sex once in a while.
maybe both of you should take a warm bath!
introduce yourself, smile, and be cordial.
are you mature enough to manage a serious relationship?
when women gather, that is one of the main topics of conversation.
you most likely would not get married anyway, so locate someone new.
because we cause them to become nervous and they lose their wits.
because they usually enjoy making you feel bad.
also they are more romantic, in my opinion.
your age is too low and an excess of negative events can result.
a reason exists to explain this occurrence. so simply practice patience. all clouds possess silver linings. "hugs".
don't forget, a man merely being aware of your involvement is no indicator that he won't still make an attempt.
i'd not even go so far as to sacrifice five seconds in service of a female who's incredibly attractive yet persistently idiotic!
correct, much benefit is derived from resisting sexual activity.
a guy that is too exhausted for sex?
you are not old, and shouldn't you be doing things that you enjoy doing?
if you want to meet pretty women i would go to the library or walmart.
in the meantime continue to flirt, and get to know him better.
do not let him see you in a depressed mood.
yes, if you speak of a male friend, he already likes you. just letting you know.
trust me, i am a guy.
tell him you do not want to marry him and if he continues, break up with him.
do you prefer circumcised or a foreskin? why?
the next day i emailed one of them and she said she did not want to be my friend.
how do i get out of it?
no, that means that you are the girl of my dreams.
we can get to know each other better.
i believe that you will find your true love some day so you need to have faith.
if you cheat once, you will most likely cheat again.
all gentlemen are different when it comes to girls; we fall for all types of girls.
tell him all relevant information.
adopt the persona of a young lady searching for an nsa coupling and send an im to him.
and he was under the impression i had an enjoyable experience.
i'm informed by her that her affection for me is genuine.
include me in the participants for that activity.
just in the event you two individuals are the closest of companions.
he did not love you, know how i know?
your charming smile baby, which costs nothing.
i do not care about them just leave them, trust me you will not get anywhere with these people.
it is important that you have to love the person you are making love with.
when i catch him staring at a woman he denies it and yells at me.
do not let a man walk over you.
why not poke every man's eyes out?
the meaning of that is that you have a new little sister.
i am _num_ years old and waited until i was married to have sex.
you should not be concerned because everyone is attracted to other people.
do men have an opinion on whether that is cute or sexy?
if a man cheats on you then you are spending time with the wrong guy.
you like a lesbian and you are not a lesbian. it makes no sense.
he is ignoring me, again.
buy her a rose bouquet for valentine's day and ask her out.
instant message me on yahoo messenger using pao__num_
go away. i need to gain two points.
i have a friend who is intersted in a man who does not feel the same way.
you do not want to lose him as a friend.
you should get some electronics.
i reccommend that you show him more love and attention.
i pray that you are preserved.
but you are not asking anything here.
most will if they get the chance but you are not married, so i think it is about _num_ probability.
i agree with user rockhead. do not tell anyone.
you should have intercourse when you are aroused.
you get even by improving from how you were when you met her.
that is the first and last time i have sex while watching television.
you cannot get married in jail.
try emailing him your question.
they act like that because they cannot "score."
see how it goes.
look at yahoo! answers.
i have gained _num_ pounds.
just because you love him, does not mean he loves you.
because pain is akin to pleasure, and when one bleeds, one experience a feeling similar to sexual release.
no, but the reason is that men's hormones are different from women's.
all of that is true. i become that way occasionally.
i suggest not taking it very seriously. it was only a dream.
that means you can have both options without leaving anything.
it is time to move on. it may hurt, but that is how life works.
do not hurt him, but do not hurt yourself either.
it is the way of life.
we are not talkign about playing dumb.
my girlfriend got mad at me.
usually, you love your partner more when you're sexually intimate.
there is a lot more happening right now.
you could talk to a boy for hours, and he would only talk about himself.
marriage is not something to joke about.
if you like him, you should go out with him and not feel the need to ask here.
i did not expect to be asked out, but i was.
if i like a man, i ask him out before another woman can.
i am not going to post that sort of peronal information here.
it appears to me that the relationship is over.
my boyfriend, who i have been involved with for longer than a year, has been lying to me the whole time.
it is the same reason as mine.
yes, as long as he loves you, then it is no longer a problem. love does not involve money, do not judge it by money.
she will always be there for you when you need her and she will care about you.
i fell to my knees. i will never forget that strange moment.
however, she has not faith in me because i've made reminiscent comments to both individuals.
i promise that every female who believes she excessively obsesses over sexual activity has no actual understanding.
be original. that's all that's necessary.
if your in a relationship with a similar women, you might want to reconsider it. if she's worth the pain.
obtain a job. then you'll have your own money.
they are very much in love and think that there is hope.
go out with her friend. maybe she will change her mind.
why are people risking so much for sex?
the best revenge is to move on with your life and forget that the cheater ever existed.
you feel happy most of the time, and you're always glowing.
be careful, he doesn't understand our conversation.
my thoughts went a little off the rails.
you can't do that, it would be disrespectful to your minister.
it is too large if it hurts a woman when inserted.
i think it is time for you to move on.
do you have a good cast iron skillet.
any man who does not like children is a coward to responsibility.
never again will television be on during sex.
tell her that if she loved you she would come over for sexual favors.
if you cannot stand being his friend then leave him alone.
you feel the best feeling you have felt in your whole life.
only when they are aroused or if you spice up the moment.
and what does it mean?
if joy can and if it concerns love, then it is probably good.
not all men, it depends on the man.
yes, it is, but are you in love?
because the color red is the color of blood but most people consider blue to be the color of love.
they end up not liking you in the end.
as long as the person agrees that it is ok.
are you used to having sex on a regular basis?
someone might be trying to break you two apart.
that guy had a small penis.
there is nothing shameful about sex.
i can't get him off of my mind.
this old man said, "hello dear, would you like to watch me change my teeth?"
it is more exciting so you're aware, being shy is a hindrance.
don't spend your money on frivolous things.
i would not leave my girlfriend over getting nude pictures from others.
just look into her eyes and smile.
it could not have been bad if they still got married.
a friend, spouse or even your family members.
you should leave him, you can make enough mistakes on your own.
but, making a person stay with you is the difficult part.
if you are in bangalore, i am here.
he lies to me and hangs the phone up on me.
i do not think it is a sin, but it ends in fornication.
i believe that being on the beach next to a fire with _num_ sounds like a wonderful time.
you are going to find someone else and wonder why you forgave this person so many times.
it depends on if you believe what books say dreams mean.
it takes plenty of patience i would say.
what in the world should i say?
but we are happy and enjoy life.
you marry because you want to spend the rest of your life with the man.
he always says sorry, but then a month later he's lying and being dishonest.
i start quiet and get louder and louder and then, bam.
i can't help thinking "was it me?"
not all men only care about coitus.
most likely his version of an enjoyable time is coitus.
if you are interested in a man, then talk with him and get to know him.
it depends on how unattractive she is.
make certain that she knows how much you love her.
don't say it to him upfront, it may have been fine once before, but not anymore.
find out what it is you don't want to do.
trust me, it can get worse.
men aren't scared of love.
no, maybe he would like to speak to you before he goes to sleep.
would you make out with him if you were not dating him?
you are wrong on that one.
a time when you cannot get a person off your mind.
i would ask her if it was yours.
tell me how someone could not like kids.
the first one i ment and wanted to marry immediately, the second is still unravelling.
i asked him, "how do you know that i am looking at you?"
and their friends will bad mouth you the their friends, and so on and so forth.
i am asking because it seems that men are always ready for sex.
never let anyone tell you otherwise.
jealousy is difficult to fight.
wear nice clothing and act well-mannered.
break up with them as soon as they get angry that you will not have intercourse with them.
i am stumped if that does not do it.
i do not like the way they curse.
yes, and now that person seems to be a good friend.
be careful because this is not the right age match and the desires differ.
the rest is window dressing.
simply inform her of your feelings and the reason you feel lovingly towards her.
well, he won't be in a marriage for a significant future period.
i'm intending to say, a beautiful appearance is merely surface-level in depth.
you will not be considered unless you do it back in return.
she was a bit of an outcast in a punk rock band who had blue eyes.
your chile wants you to be present, and sending money is not preferrable to that.
you should be aware of the concept of discrimination based on sexual orientation and that it is wrong.
i have a preference for hispanic men.
if i do, then why would i be looking through his items?
not love, but who knows?
force her as no bra is not attractive.
most likely the flirting led you to believe he wanted to pursue further.
if that does not work, tell him you have an std.
she is plain in the opinions of others, but to me she is my true love. that is all.
in areas where african american men live.
no, you need to be wise.
if you mean here, the internet, then that is the wrong place.
i have heard many men say that they prefer virgins.
also a nice posterior and small breasts, as strange as that sounds.
because they are addicted to sexual pleasure.
if the man does not like her, then advise her to move on with her life.
clearly you determined that you have no desire to have sex with him or the event would have already occurred.
in such an event, what's the duration of your marriage?
try "yes" if you like him, and "no" if you do not!
trust your sense of humor, your beauty, your intelligence, you relationships and how you connect with others, and characteristics like that.
you are doing the right thing. just divorce him, and get back to living your life.
stop dreaming and thinking about what could be.
if he genuinely loves you, then he would not care whether or not you have anything to offer.
you can go to the beach or a restaurant.
you need to tell him. the worst he can do is say no.
you should be friends with him.
after i busted him cheating of course.
well, try kissing him. are there any sparks?
yeah, but you get more horny than fall in love.
games, don't play them. you always loose.
what will you be doing as i eat my chocolates and enjoy my roses?
a man is a man.
do you want to have sexual relations or no?
you cannot help what you dream about and a fantasy is only that, a fantasy.
if she pooped on me, i would leave the room.
get with better men because i will expect her to do the same.
wait it out if he gets the point.
all she dreams about is him when she does.
do not compromise your peace and salvation for anyone.
yes, i guess i like the rough types of guys.
i was like _num_, and that was _num_ months ago, and i am still with her.
do you think she will know that you like her without telling her?
be sure not to profess your love too early in the relationship.
they'll never be like you.
i care about him a lot, and i miss him.
you broke up with him, so leave this up to him.
i see that you like the goo goo dolls! have you ever seen them play a concert?
she is not a materialistic woman.
there is no way to answer that without sounding like a racist, and i am not.
it is deciding who i want to marry.
you can do what you want to do, or not.
things started to change later that month.
tell her to think twice about it.
how about a nice personalized gift that you make by hand?
then it is up to her to listen or not and take the hard way or the easy way.
that is not the type of man you want.
have you ever had an argument like that?
you do not even know how old he is?
as little as possible. you can forgive and forget.
he is more mature because he is three to five years older.
at least you can trust us, because even if we lied you would know.
movies are fun, but it does not provide much of a chance to bond.
she tried using the credit cards and found out that they did not work.
i am able to tell that all of you girls think differently.
dreams are just our brains working things out.
you're playing with fire!
knock that guy upside his head.
you might not like it, but you should pretend to.
marriage is better, no one said that it was easy.
if not, someone will find you.
how old are you? i guess that is irrelevant, you should run.
i am not attracted to you anymore.
if i did, i wouldn't look at yahoo answers.
so you tried it once, that means nothing.
if my husband cheated, i would punish him severely, and publicly.
i get hungry twice a day.
i laughed hard when i read it.
i love talking to him, and i do not feel good unless i talk to him.
friends are hard to come by.
getting her intoxicated and then kissing her worked for me.
if he's so conceited, he is not worth the simple goodness of your love.
that's what made me date matt.
my yahoo chat name was previously "oscreamifyoudoitright."
simply ask her. she will probably like for you to have some help.
he or she will understand.
my wife kissed me then left with the children.
remove your clothing in his presence. you will know.
i did learn that he likes me.
i am, because if i was not, then i would be a girl.
if he has friends, then perhaps maybe he likes you.
why would a man decide not to date a virgin?
who has married their high school sweetheart?
have you seen the movie 'the game?'
you should just leave him lone, he got eht he wanted, and maybe he does not want to talk to you anymore.
if you do not leave him alone, you might run into some trouble.
i have gone out on dates, but, not as many as if i were to play dumb.
i bet you will think it is love at first sight when we meet.
you are probably too good for her anyway.
if not the pet store, just look around the barns.
you do not just lose the girl because she will stay to hurt you and love doing it.
it is very easy, just tell him talk to me or get out of my life, that is all honey bun.
just say i love me too.
it isn't as beneficial to the individual possessing the accessible treasure.
well, it's clear if she refuses to inform you, she prefers that you are not privy to the information.
i inquired as to whether he continued to feel positively towards me and he responded negatively.
and look at photographs of men.
do what is morally right and what you feel like doing.
why do you not have a job?
be a nice man and do not take women for granted.
you are a foolish person and if you were my child, then you would not be allowed to date.
she is using you in order to come here.
you need to speak with him regarding it and ask him to stop.
i would like to know if it is alright.
you should have sex right before going to bed.
if he talks about it, then show that you care and listen to him.
do not do that to yourself!
for the same reason that men do it!
you need to move on and find someone that loves you.
he has a boyfriend that is his friend too.
i was dating a friend of my girlfriend, and we broke up.
if he is kind to you and has a nice personality, then yes.
if he is interested in you, then tell him that you love him. it will initiate a romance. it worked well for me.
if you are a man, then yes.
i am afraid to ask him if he is still interested in me, because i used to feel the same.
ask her permission if you are not certain.
you do not need him or anyone else to degrade you.
i could not hurt someone i loved like that.
have you ever cheated on her in the past?
i can not stand a woman who is like that.
no, but you could be someones bi-sexual partener.
make secret admirer notes with clues specific to you.
do not tell him upfront.
no, you have to get to know her.
love always finds a way if you two are meant to be.
this is the problem with america.
either you get along with this person or you don't.
don't know, cook him dinner and show him you care.
we think we are giving them signals but they don't get it.
although i'm sure they could, we all know what the decision would be.
maybe you should not be worried at all.
kiss her on the cheek first, and if she understands what you mean she will carry on from there.
my husband and i moved in after two weeks.
it is how you use it and not the size.
you are welcome to party, too, because everyone has the right to enjoy my girlfriend while she is stripping.
all you can do is think about them when you hear that love song.
are you in love with someone?
she is still your friend regardless.
i know quite a bit, email me and i will talk to you.
don't try to impress her, just express your feelings towards her.
are you part irish?
maybe that is why they are called fantasies.
some understand it and do very well, while others do not.
they do not have to be half dressed.
if you find the answer to that question, please let me know.
i want to do things with you that i would not even do to an oreo.
i am very mature, so do not mess with me!
do not go up to him and say that you want to have relations with you sister very badly.
until that time, try to be kinder.
if you really like him, you'll simply know!
not a bad person at all.
it doesn't matter if you're doing everything accurately.
try to be kind, relaxed, calm, and let her know you like her.
people do not do things unless they benefit them in some way.
i believe a woman should make her own decisions.
you should call him and ask.
i am a twenty year-old woman.
people invent many reasons to explain why they have not found the right person.
you could still have a friendship. you could even have a friendship and continue having sex.
furthermore, you are hoping that he will propose marriage to you.
will you go on a date with me?
if you wait, you will not get anywhere.
you just have to be normal.
i make a different choice every so often.
start to find someone more compatable and closer in age.
have i told you lately that i love you?
it can mean different things.
look at what you are wearing.
when you like someone, who feels the same way towards you.
you aren't getting anything.
you should focus on getting level _num_ next.
she should make a decision, so she can prevent getting pregnant.
from a woman's perspective, i don't think about intercourse as much as my ex boyfriend.
i do not like to complain though.
one question i have is why would you want to marry a person who is in jail?
we have flirted many times but i am simply unsure.
it is not men in general, it is the particular man that you dated.
however, i immediately disliked him.
then there are many questions on whether i have had anal intercourse.
speak with your eyes.
women want it slow and take too long to obtain it. men want it without a build-up.
and we sat on my bed, made eye contact, hugged, and kissed passionately.
why get married? simply become someone's coitus slave.
you have accept the sad truth.
do you not love your ex girlfriend, at all?
you have two choices. get over him, or wait for him.
now days, it is hard to find a virgin.
you are a liar.
i am just wondering, thank you for the answer.
i suggest you find the company of a tough, manly male.
i care for him greatly, but only as a friend.
i am a self-proclaimed sex-addict. i do not know if something is wrong with me, or if i simply enjoy sex.
she may tell the truth to you if she does not want to be with you any longer.
if you do not want to have sex with the man, it is okay to say no.
who broke up with who?
you should dress like a lady and you may find a nicer man.
i'll try anything once, and once more if i enjoy it.
as long as it doesn't become physical. i don't see why not.
i'm uncertain. are you ready?
jon stated to wait with matt.
he'll be pleasantly surprised, and will love you all the more for it.
and i told him yes. very much.
be unfaithful to her with one of her friends and be better to the friend than you were to her.
why bother if you do not intend to marry him?
the problem is that women who have a bad scent do not know it.
most men care about that while some do not.it depends on the man.
tell him to go away.
you really should break up with him and get yourself some self-esteem.
it is probably because women do not like weak men.
yes, men think about copulation more that girls.
perhaps it because you are doing something incorrectly.
simply because someone is older does not mean he is near death.
are there reasons you do not trust him?
i recommend handing them a toilet brush.
let me know if you want more at digital_lyricist@yahoo.com.
if you want to get married, then you should do so.
i do not believe in astrology.
men are beautiful regardless of anything else.
you should just ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
too much of a good thing can turn into a bother.
they have a one-track mind.
does he like your kids, and vice versa?
you should have your fun now, while you are young.
because it is called lust, which is a sin.
i simply have some anxiety about it.
my new girl means quite a bit to me.
make sure it is good, wholesome fun.
now you receive two of everything.
there is a man for every woman.
go to the movies, sight-seeing, etc.
that is slightly difficult.
you need to get angry.
perhaps she wants to have intercourse with someone other than you.
from where do you obtain these statistics?
if you connect with someone then do not worry about other people's feelings.
i love being sexual on the phone with my boyfriend.
just tell him in person, nicely, that you are done.
it is easy to find someone to marry you in jail.
what if some man asked, why are all women promiscuous?
she may act like that again, but thank you i will be sure to tell him.
don't let anyone convince you otherwise.
if he is going to mart the girl, she shouldn't have been with many other men.
i am a man with traditional values.
you are a sinner if the people you call friends are unsaved.
you can only rely on faith that what the other person says is truth.
she may have the same feelings that you do.
some men say a good girlfriend must have good looks, habits and a great figure.
consider getting a job and sending him money.
gift her with a nice present, then ask her immediately.
in that event she will certainly think you are hiding something.
do not focus on looks; rather, evaluate people on how they treat you.
does anyone here possess the ability to speak fluent english?
it is about the one who you are with.
who could say no?
please repeat, "it's not my fault!".
i have two. your decision.
she questioned me regarding my sensitivities.
my husband will make a right, and be there.
then one day he began to court me.
only if you feel as though you need a boyfriend.
no, because the same thing happened to me, but it may be different.
would it bother him if you were asking men for photographs?
you are just experiencing new things which is a good thing.
not if it was not meant to be.
if he likes you for your activities, then start doing ones that he would not like.
you might spook him if you talk about marriage, kids, and family.
send flowers but not roses, that might be too strong.
you do not have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down.
when matt and i first got together, i really like jon and i did not know he liked me also.
i would hide their lunch box and not play with them at recess.
no, i think you cannot spell.
you probably can do a lot better.
that is not any of your business!
in addition, it make speople more jealous and anxious so watch out for that also.
i have had this problem many times and i say to keep both of them but be very careful about your choices!
it may be too late to attempt a procedure.
i will tell you what a lot of men i know dream of.
if he treated her right, i see nothing wrong with it. it is not as if she is your sister.
men love themselves. it is unhealthy.
if she likes you, then she should know that you are new at it.
it's dependent upon yourself. however, is it something you'd desire to have happen?
however, it simply vexes me due to the fact that i'd like to engage with him, however, i have a desire to postpone!
should you fancy another gentleman, however, it's most advantageous to simply express it!
do you not have one or are you having trouble with the one you have?
he is not an addict.
be friendly and not forward.
he probably did not answer your calls because he was truly busy.
ask them when they are hooked up to a lie detector.
i like him but i am not in love with him.
go to the gym and workout. practice speaking with a lower voice and be confident.
i would be straight up with your friend.
you can do better.
tell him that your baby is in need of him.
i feel too old and i am only _num_
do not blow it on a thing called intercourse.
why can they not treat us with respect?
he is probably cheating on you if he is still talking to her.
once she leaves him karma will come around and get back to him.
i would say yes in most cases.
women are not easily sexually aroused, you need heop
do not probe, let him tell you when he feels competent enough to do it.
if i had to choose a certain man, he would be black, white men do not use form
no, you need to get him out of you life and find someone else.
now i am pregnant with his child. how do i tell him without upsetting him?
refrain from prolonging the process, however, assure that it's brief and direct.
do you have a desire to be criticized as unintelligent?
i'm uncertain since my spouse-to-be and myself both have that quality.
my man tells me it gives him the opportunity to tell me that i am attractive.
i, too, like children but i am not one.
it is not just confined to men.
i would not necessarily break off a friendship simply because we have a disagreement.
can you see yourself as being contented with this person for the rest of your life?
think about the reason that the two of you broke up and then move on.
go where your phallus leads you, even if it is in the wrong direction.
i need advice from other people.
dump you girlfriend, trust me, she would be shocked.
a personality that is not too bad.
i do not think that girls are bad liars.
well, it disgusts me , but others get intense pleasure from it, you never know.
it is only normal to cool off, i guess.
you must inquire of yourself whether you have feelings for him!
seems like a low-quality partner, in my opinion. however, that's solely my opinion.
if you are attracted to males and females, you're therefore bisexually oriented.
he ought to possess enough compassion, not toy with a person's emotions.
to begin, select specifically a single man you're enraptured by.
men are also people, and they have feelings just as women do.
i cannot think of any reason.
i would not want my boyfriend to have lunch with a different woman on valentines day.
there are many reasons that marriages break up, including financial issues, children, infidelity, and stress.
older children might enjoy putt putt golf, laser tag, or go-karts.
i have loved my boyfriend for eight years.
i am mature for my age as well.
when you find someone special, hopefully they will love you for you.
she is the boss, and you had an intimate moment with her, that is all.
my concern is how to say now while remaining friends.
unless you tell him the truth, you will never be certain.
i am a man and recommend that you proceed slowly and steadily.
my recommendation is that you tell them directly and at the right moment, and not when many people are present.
those who are patient receive good things.
show her she is more important than your friends.
first of all, no, it is not always about the outward appearance of a woman.
however, he is as clueless as i am.
i have been nothing but nice to her every day. what should i do?
what kind of father does that make him?
if she breaks your heart, it will be your fault, you should have listened to my advice.
i loved this man, but he humiliated me in front a small crowd, and i don't know what i should do now.
perhaps, you two should separate for a short period of time.
it is an easier way of saying he just wants to have intercourse.
are you just excited about being in love?
if he wants to be friends, then so be it.
have you ever wondered why they fight all of the time?
that i all they ever think about.
we are not mind readers.
that guy is misleading you.
you are single and can not find a date.
if you become involved in trouble, then you will leave with trouble.
i forgot about an important question for women: have you ever used the sample cosmetics at the shopping mall?
or, one day, kiss him.
and it depends on if he likes war games, sports, role-playing, etc.
all men do it, even when they are married.
i enjoy dreaming of different men, which i suppose is acceptable.
however, you will never find a woman willing to admit it.
if you are asking this, it means you love your wife.
if he does not know who you are, it appears very difficult, but it is worth trying.
brush your mouth twice and there will be no trouble.
some men are stunned when they are around an attractive woman like myself.
if not, no. if you are younger than twelve, then no.
what you do is simple, know their emotions and discuss them.
the pay is great, but there is a lot of stuff in those places.
it will depend on how it is.
you will not meet anyone who wants to have a serious relationship unless you have a big penis.
is that true? i tried talking to him but he will not return my calls.
tell them how sad you are.
come join me in romania, i already live there!
one day you wake up with the knowledge.
they are happy, so it could work for you as well.
trust me, you do not do anything with a friend's younger sister.
if you only want to be with him, then stay with him.
we should converse via yahoo, shrunkenmann_thegrass (females exclusively).
she sincerely admires you and believes you share a friendship and most likely not anything further.
i would't be concerned regarding the embarrassment quotient that's present.
oh, indeed, if you genuinely feel compelled to do so...deliver one to him, as well.
you have some work to do.
you need to have a serious talk with her and let her know that it is childish and you are maturing.
communication, but are you certain you want to do that?
if you cannot say the words to his face, scream them in the mirror when he is not around. do you know why?
do not do anything.
no, it is only if they are sick.
you will show him how if not.
i am looking for a virgin girl.
yes, your mother is going steady with him.
he will love you even more.
if you think this could lead to heartbreak, then wait and watch what happens!
he must have been a friend at one time.
the phrase to use is "i have enough friends".
keep your eye on her because she is not much of a best friend.
yahoo personals may have a man you might like.
then tell him that you could go on a date sometime, if he is interested.
examine that for a time.
perhaps my mother, but that is another story.
you may be too attractive for your own good.
go on a cruise and push her overboard.
please don't push her or tell her that you love her.
that is not a bad thing if you enjoy it with a responsible person.
because they don't think with the heads on their shoulders.
you should believe in yourself, which is really sexy.
i have dated several bisexual females and it turns out big time.
if i am truly considering it, i would prefer to be with both of them.
no, he simply likes exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
both; but, if i must choose only one, then beauty.
from my point of view, whatever your instinct tells you is happening is what is happening.
i suppose a little of both.
have sex with a loved one.
as lumbeeman said, "have your best friend tell him for you."
yes, he is a man and that is what we do!
but every time i return it is the same bad things over again.
try to allow him to know you.
you do not know what real problems are until you get married and have children.
that is a lie. if you love the person, then your relationship will remain steady no matter what happens.
i always feel like him when we meet.
he may be checking to see if you are alright.
as long as you have love, life will be full of sweet meanings.
you can contact me at anytime.
you are still going to feel as though you cannot trust men.
you cannot expect to give him anything too expensive.
believe what you want to believe.
i would date a woman who was a stripper because it would not matter who she was.
sense of humor is very important.
he says that he respects that i want to wait and he understands.
i thought this man was interested in me. he used to stare at me often.
but if you are fine with it, then it should be alright.
simply assure her that her parents both love her very much even though they do not live together any longer.
you will prove to be a great sister.
i suppose people want what they cannot have.
you can like whoever you like.
you should tell her to wait.
you should tell your partner and understand his response. help yourself to help one another.
my husband and i got married, july _num_, _num_ and went to hawaii for two weeks.
if you are not, it will be rough intercourse and will hurt.
what do i do with both of them?
i would sya no, unless you love it.
there are some men who do not care what they look like.
where do you want it to go?
maybe he isn't lonely.
let him go if he continues to harass you.
how much success will you feel when you find love?
try understanding women and then you'll find one.
what does love mean anymore?
you urinate from that place, and do not even wipe.
a man that is not complete desperate will not ask you out again if you broke up with him, already.
we try to make females feel comfortable.
if i see you with another girl, i will rip her arms off.
you need to get a job.
you have to ask yourself if he is a nice and decent person.
i have a friend who has a very, very cool piercing on the hood of her clitoris.
so, how do i approach a woman and ask her to come over to my place, and to be my girlfriend?
then, you know what you have to do then, forgive them.
it is true what everyone else said.
i would rather have a girl who is not a virgin.
to surprise her, tell her in the middle of a conversation.
if he does that, he cares for you.
if you are true, true love will find you.
see if she returns your email, or you will find out in person.
it is easier to move on, two wrongs do not make it right.
tell them that they will never get anywhere in life by decieving people!
dogs are like apart of the family, trust me , i know!
do it only if your heart desires you to have it, if you instincts say do not do it, then do not go through with it.
of course, stop and say hello.
if they are hurting themselves too much to listen, however, find another adult such as a grandparent.
i know a woman who was married to a violent man who abused their children.
it is because they have a guilty conscience.
after the police left, the guy was in custody, and the kids were back in bed.
if she is not willing, stop trying to do it.
i would like to talk to someone.
you are like a complete stranger to me.
i do not think that most guys are stupid.
well you are a lesbian, if you are a girl who is attracted to a lesbian!
even if there is some truth to what he is saying, why would he text message other women, asking for their nude photographs?
i love my ex with all of my heart.
firstly, do not tel him. go to your mother, or a school social worker, and et them talk to your parents.
it is not as difficult if you know what you are doing.
if it is love, he will wait and not be unfaithful to you.
make them laugh and they will love you.
men like this are not worthwhile.
unless you enjoy being treated poorly.
i would not enjoy being the seventh man if she thinks of the eighth.
i will be twenty-one years old on august _num_, _num_ that's true.
this is the love which most people seek but are too lazy to earn.
perhaps because they knew you would be very angry.
converse with her and discover whether or not she is interested in you.
that is a great way to start the day.
i gave him a second chance but he did not take it.
when she is free and has the desire to do so, she will.
on top with the lights on is stimulating.
be a friend. allow him some time to be alone.
you are beginning to dislike the friends of the person to who you love.
do something that most people have not done.
it seems to me that love does not die so quickly.
in that case, i think it is nothing to worry about.
most likely, she still lives with her parents.
that is a serious mistake.
as she is still with you, she cares for you.
do not worry about those types of things.
he is playing hard to get and you are not.
i am not sure that chickens are concerned with that.
you will get out of it what you put into it.
perhaps yes, if you smell better.
move on and think about how lucky you are to not be with him!
what can i do to get her to lose weight?
leave him because he is not worth your time.
a lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
if he is too possessive then break it off.
when you can hear each other with out talking.
you will not be disappointed if you try it sometime.
it was insensitive of her to do those things in front of you. it is obvious!
other than that go to a party and hit on intoxicated women.
question him? it might be uncomfortable, but it will be worth it if he loves you.
state, "i love you.", if it's true love. it will occur when it needs to.
it will be worth it.
i'm attracted to imbeciles. what's my issue?
should i pack my husband's bags?
you do not have to have a relationship.
why does my ex boyfriend keep trying to make me jealous?
my best friend is a man. we have never attempted to take it further.
in my case, it did not.
hang out with her, perhaps take her shopping...
sorry, but no - he is seeing someone.
if you love someone, simply tell him so.
my father is the same way.
it sounds like he needs to mature.
i am not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
so, firstly, boys say things they do not really mean.
just find another girl, she does not love you.
marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
really get to know her.
i have a child and am married; but, i want to be single.
if you care that much, find another man.
you deserve someone who will listen to you first.
only if you are of age.
he said, "hello, woman. what is going on?"
and you already had intercourse with this man.
you can apologize, but you cannot have him again. accept what you already decided.
try to watch pornography together.
you need to ask her why she does not like you.
do not make a move because she has a boyfriend.
it can work if you want it to.
you have missed your chance and she has moved on.
you know you are in love if you are intimate with him.
because, as you know, i attend the same school as you.
i invite the women reading this to tell him.
just be patient and do not rush.
i once heard that is was not so.
furthmore, avoid the plants that i mentioned.
people are not always smart.
it is never a boring thing.
i have been with my husband since i was _num_ and i am going to be _num_ next month.
never buy a woman lingerie unless it is something she has said she wants.
i do not think it is a bad choice.
i asked her to dance and now we are friends.
either that or attempt to find his other personality and accept him.
if he cannot respect you, then he has to leave.
in truth, whether or not my friends agree, they cannot ever find another friend like me.
instead of telling him, show him what you like.
you do not find her. it will happen on its own.
you do understand they are using you, do you not?
since you are not sure, then you know it is not worth it.
i would marry your cat to get into the family.
before too long. you made them love you even though it was bad for them.
i am right here. all you need to do is ask.
become akin to wild animals. have intercourse at any location.
good luck. you will need it.
is it legal, or just not morally right?
my sister is not intelligent and is pregnant with his baby.
a girl should know what she wants.
he had slept with his best friends wife.
do you really enjoy hurting people who are so important to you?
you are the one who must that you don't want to be unhappy any longer.
i would not want or need anyone else.
it was an event that occurred without your knowledge.
i suggest that you focus first on becoming a friend to a woman.
he probably won't tell you but he's likely to tell someone else.
because when you are in a relationship and you go our for fun it kills your partner.
he is a piece of shit and i never want to see him again.
she might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around and stuff but she can't fake that.
maybe you have but you didn't know it.
planning is good, but don't plan excessively.
we get along wonderfully except for this one difficulty.
could now be a good time to move on to a different place?
he or one of your friends who knows him might know. ask one of them.
tell him that you are a beautiful vampire.
the coaches were more relaxed, and i usually played over half the game.
they have left us no choice but to separate, but i will never stop loving him.
begin by stating that i want to kiss you on the nose, mouth, cheek, and neck in that order.
do not tell him you want to have sex with him.
i am not sure, are you in love?
wait and it will be worth the time.
i do not believe you should afford him any more chances. you do not want to be hurt again.
he will discover that with someone else., but you want something more, do you not?
cause them to want to break up with you.
if he loves you, then he will be in pain, but he will recover.
you should not be with a man who pressures you to do things that you are not comfortable with.
some men that have experience do not know what they are doing.
be intmate with people who are good at math. they know how to handle curves.
you have to overdose to get off.
you have tried too hard.
what was that about? now i am curious as well.
a high class strip club with a lot of alcohol.
yes, i would at any time.
this is not the place to find one.
yes, if you stop being lazy.
that also depends on who you are.
yes, at least mine do it live.
if you never give it a chance, you'll never know what might have transpired between you two.
i've never heard of a man who did not enjoy this.
well, if he's going to so much trouble to frighten you, it seems apparent that he is not attracted to you.
things this important should not be addressed via email.
why would you ask something so simple, stereotypical, and pointless?
i merely want to help her realize it before something bad happens.
that is not very fair to the man with whom you are currently in a relationship.
they want a genuine man. i do, at least.
i think it is strange and geeky.
that is not a good situation.
if you like him, then it is not bad.
he might only want to have sex with you.
you might love him, but you need to leave him.
you have every right to be upset.
send the man a post card from bora bora or somewhere exotic.
maybe you should tell her and see how she responds.
why would you care, it is fine as long as you received yours, correct?
i one hundred percent agree with you there.
a hard face to go with it.
i've asked her to by my girlfriend two times already but she never answers.
you've got nothing better to do with the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
caring is not everything.
i am _num_ and i have a girlfriend.
ask him to be your boyfriend and that you like him.
that is not bad at all.
you already know so much about one another.
i never talk badly about a person.
you are confusing me, one question at a time.
cheat on her with a prostitute. they have experience.
not only men have them, women can too!
do not use intercourse as a weapon in your marriage.
that way you get to be with other women while not cheating.
what happened to his queen kong?
maybe but i will never find him.
do not do it in private.
it does not matter what gender they are.
take a shower, use deodorant, and always have fresh breath.
whether or not you are wearing a skirt and heeled shoes or loose jeans.
return to pleasuring yourself orally.
he used to abuse me mentally and physically.
i have dated guys who are tall and muscular.
do you have the same kind of behind as a chicken?
if you like her, ask her on a date, and see what happens from there.
tell your man that you do not like that man.
no man wants to be only friends with women.
what do you think about marriage?
i would not date a large man.
try to stay out of it this time untill they are calm.
i like the song 'sex and candy.'
it is better to loose a lover then like someone with no ambition.
if i guy did that to me, i would move on.
the way i have always approached it is to go out with a friend.
in the first place, do not do anything unless you want to do it.
i agree with gab's observation that there is no way to know.
as a _num_-year old woman, you should look for someone of a similar age.
do not pressure women as it will not result in a positive response.
why don't you give her a telephone card, or send her a valentine's card?
you might lose the one you love, to another person.
my best friend went on a date with a very short man and they even kissed each other.
i am only _num_, why would anyone lie about that age?
what exactly do men want from women?
last night, when i was talking with my former lover, i asked that question of him.
if he is a nice man, then he will understand and probably stop if he likes you.
and one additional piece of advice: trust her.
surprise him, you can do it!
just wait. maybe it is not the time for you to meet the right one.
no, it is not normal, it is abnormal.
i am confused. what were you asking?
if he did, he would not even have looked at the other girl.
if i could arrange the alphabet, i would put u next to i.
personally, i cannot even think of going out with someone i broke up with.
why do men cheat?
she has been living for you.
where do you live?
you seem to be hanging onto a dream, dr. checko.
who can assemble me again?
ask someone you trust, or, a doctor.
someone who loves you should consider your feelings.
where does the child's father come into play?
you should date your cousin.
my girlfriend, my love, my everything, she is perfect.
men can be friends with women.
you may find that you don't like having intercourse with women.
i believe unintelligent far exceeds foolish.
because once they are interested, there is no longer any need to pursue them.
why would you go with someone who is that young or old?
some men have attractive posteriors.
if he is trying to control you, then leave.
if you truly care for this person then you ought to try it.
no, i would prefer the woman who rejected me die suddenly. i will not care about her at all anymore.
there is no doubt. i am positive.
i think that "no answer" is your response and you simply do not want to acknowledge it.
what are you worried about because love conquers all?
it never can be if you are a teenager or child.
pick them up around midnight at the nursing home and go to wendy's.
i love my child's father to death!
this guy has not been in a relationship for a significant amount of time.
read this and tell her to stop.
who is on your mind?
men will not consider cheating if the sex remains interesting and exciting.
sit down with them and explain to them that they should be understanding and support you no matter what happens.
i am merely his friend. i love him, but he seems not to know.
and do you have a problem with this?
perform the second step if you see no results after three weeks.
i have an id in yahoo with a camera.
the man is married!
it is usually the person who is not as good in bed as the other.
it is not boring but fulfilling.
i prefer the lights off, with a few candles and on top of the covers.
where were you in sex ed?
do not take anything for granted.
they are not worth your time and thoughts.
why would he refuse to speak with me?
i enjoy a man with a round posterior, it's attractive.
i have male acquaintances that are similar to a sibling. there's no apprehension.
i heard that a coat hanger, and a vacuum will assist with it.
you should have a nice impression on the woman.
gather all of your girlfriends and have a party to let her mingle with new faces.
you spelling tells how worried you are.
that is a good start because you sound attractive.
nobody can do it better than you.
you are very earth-friendly.
remember that a lot of married men are very happy.
do not act as though you are pure.
i have the same problem so i know what you mean.
i am sorry this guy said that about you.
do not mind what other people want.
what do you want to do now?
you need to learn to read a person.
the man said "i am a caveman". the woman responded "what's this?".
yes, i believe you should rehome the cat.
you should text him.
my masculine ego cannot handle a woman knowing about it.
if you can afford it, women love jewelry.
if she likes the beach, then perhaps a weekend in the bahamas.
that is how i think about this.
say no if you do not like the men that asked you out.
it can be attractive to watch a woman, and you might get a pointer or two.
you need to do it in person, make a dinner date.
if you do not use birth control, you might get pregnant.
he is ignoring you for the exact same reason that we are!
when i went out there i noticed the same thing!
i am _num_ years old, and i look pretty good.
you should tell her to try asking him out or something similar.
your question allows people to know that you are single.
you should put your female friends before potential romantic interests.
i would not give my life for a stranger or for a friend.
people don't care for strangers.
tell him you will only do it this way.
call and greet them, and just be done with it.
touch her privates with your nose.
she isn't attracted to you.
like myself, i am currently in a long distance relationship.
what in the world are you doing?
do not let her play games with you.
it can not be love, because you do not know her.
it is better to tell someone news over the phone or in person.
you will not find love in the internet.
do not center your life around her.
take her out on a date.
tell them that they should have asked you earlier as you already have a date.
two points for me and you.
if there is nothing better to do.
she may have an underlying factor that makes her eat this much?
if she is pregnant then it is the end of the procedure.
i was going to ask this question.
it is the one thing that comes before good health on the fuman scale of existance.
women like to be pampered so take her to dinner or order in with candles and flowers and treat her like a queen.
i like romantic love and it is really fun, too.
so what do you think?
it is neither special nor weird, it is just your personal choice.
can you check it out for me please?
the question is the opposite. how do you convince your boyfriend to cease courting another woman.
i went to one where they had a belly dancer instead. it was boring.
she already knows that it is not love.
i would not worry about the heroine.
i like to tell jokes and laugh.
it is going to hurt, no matter what you say and how you say it.
what are you good at?
do not be late, or someone else might take the opportunity.
if they are not, why would they be so mean?
start cutting him off now so he is accustomed to him by the time you are married.
i recommend saying "i love you," which will watch them off guard.
he clearly does not accept you for yourself, so there is no point in staying and being miserable.
i believe that they will. why do you not?
once you cross the line from friendship it is hard to go back.
i think men are more sensitive, but women show it more often.
get a life and relax.
just go ahead and text them!
do not stay with someone who is not right for you. it is not worth it.
you should not believe in it as it is too commercialized.
i think he may be taking advantage of you.
one may be good in bed, and the other may be a good listener.
you are correct, but i must do it or she will be very upset with me.
it is what you make of it.
why is he sleeping outside with the dog?
at night, do you dream about her?
you have to strike up conversations at the places and activities you enjoy.
i do not want to shake your hand either.
you will not want anything else if you are truly in love.
honey, i love you with all my heart.
get yourself together, and don't let it bother you, just have fun dating.
i think she likes me because we flirt, and the two of us converse a lot.
remain calm, do it, and remember this isn't going to be the best moment in life.
her appearance doesn't matter.
being eight is hard is it not?
he will ask for your hand in marriage.
the information given was a little vague.
i have many friends that are guys and girls.
i hope things turn out right.
keep your carefree tone from now on.
marriage results in people acting irresponsible and abusive.
the chances are slim.
what is the worst thing that they could say?
i assume he wants you to have intercourse over the phone with him, but maybe you do not?
are you implying that there is something not good about me?
did you read what you just wrote?
and believe me, priorities are important qualities for which to search.
they do not see them, they feel them.
if you are looking to get married and settle down.
i took my neighbor to the doctors at _num_ last night after work.
please her sexually as well.
simply inform her that you occasionally require a hug.
if a guy did not care, then he would not bother.
it was a man, not a boy.
you can not change them.
you have to ask him first.
there is no way to know her virginity untill you have sex.
be careful and use protection.
some men just need a bit more stimulation to achieve a satisfying ending.
i frequently tell my man that i like him.
what are a girl's options?
all men love to be in competitions.
you should marry the person you can not live without.
do you want to have a girlfriend or a boyfriend?
sex is about giving satifastion, and not being selfish.
adam and eve were smart.
it is only about sex for some guys.
my guess is that you do not look the same to her. if you do not inspire her, she feels unimpressed.
you never know, try flirting with women because i find that helps.
yes, i believe there is hope.
find a new boyfriend, you are a girl, it should be easy.
maybe you need mr. just for me.
the way she responds will tell you if she is the right person or not.
if she cannot do the time by raising her child, then do not do the crime and become pregnant.
well, i would believe what a woman says to you.
if you are beautiful, comment on her hair, outfit, or her shoes.
once you have talked to her, then decide where you are going to live.
some people consider being a lesbian or gay is not acceptable.
adding sex to a friendship does not always amount to love to both men and women.
at least he would like for you to be involved.
do they hold the opinion that he lacks confidence?
i love my sister, but she seems to put herself into unhealthy relationships.
that is why they call it love.
he accepted my newborn daughter as his own.
you have to remember "food" and "sex" if you want to attract your husband's attention and have sex.
if you watched spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off guard and just lay it on him.
as thick as you want it.
do not think you will not be getting pleasure from it.
it should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you, go for it!
if you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
you have been dating the wrong women.
you might loose them if you hide.
tell him to close hsi eyes if you are shy.
who needs him if he acts like that?
he has some serious emotional issues.
you may have already made her uncomfortable.
let me guess, you'll relocate to new zealand?
tell him he is the boss, or leave him to find someone else.
personality first and foremost, then being in shape, finally, kindness.
we are all a little strange.
your mom kicked out the wrong person.
if you haven't slept together yet, don't.
to start having boyfriends, _num_ but dating like going on dates, _num_
by the way he looks at you and acts toward you.
my father lost approximately _num_ pounds just by playing outside.
if these do not work out, leave things as they were and start over in a new direction.
no. why can't a man talk to another woman without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating on her?
it means exactly what she says it means.
i am twenty eight years old and single.
perhaps you find a location that is far enough from home, but close enough so your family can visit once a month?
just approach him and have a casual conversation.
i guess they need to see who is the bigger loser.
if you cannot trust her without you around, then you need to leave her.
i would advise you to not hold back.
i am trying to think about what is on my mind, that's all.
i am not fond of the word "stupid".
my ex said the same thing once before.
a dance is just a dance.
you have a boyfriend that loves you and you love him, too.
if you are not married and have sex it is painful and bloody.
go to an important vacation resort.
absoulutely, if it feels right
you can find someone better.
about _num_-_num_ is my guess.
i am too busy to respond.
not all men funtion the same way.
of course she yelled about it at the time.
i swear, it was very long.
tell your lover how special they are to you and why.
i made it and you can as well.
if they avoid the question and/or get angry, then i would be worried.
i suppose you have tried to talk to him?
many women like it when you make eye-contact.
yes, find your next boyfriend. lonely people are out there waiting for you, move forward.
i have a mix between the two.
is it cool when you are in sixth grade?
it takes time to remember the good times and forget the bad.
you should introduce yourself.
good for her for being pation even when it upset her.
it once happened to me.
because you are the only beautiful woman that i see!
how can you tell if someone is truly in love with you?
it does look funny kind of, especially if the girl is significantly taller, but, it is not bad.
no, they cannot because somewhere deep down under there is an attraction to each other.
why would you do something like that and tell people about it?
if someone does not ask you on a date, does that mean you are unattractive or something?
love will come to you, so do not rush, alright?
my problem is that i anger women because i am smarter than them.
you know what he is doing, but you do not care, because you allow him to lie.
i believe it depends on how mature the child is.
i say to think long and hard about it.
oh, and tell your boyfriend why you do not like him.
you may not find her attractive; but, she is happy with herself.
after one month, i can fall in love.
it is similar to suicide; normal to think about, but not do anything about it.
move on and stalk someone else.
i no longer want to be in a relationship with him.
how can i tell him?
they are not good for you.
i rather like slightly overweight men.
have fun or stay busy.
how do i know if i am madly in love with her?
you can do many things.
guys are always commenting on my butt.
the devil's hell hounds are tracking his every step
see what she says and then you will have your answer
is he ruining his life?
some are way out there.
because they are loved and if they were not they would not find it.
it will make him feel bad and he will probably not want to have intercourse with you again.
it would seem you have decided to divorce your wife.
something must be missing from their relationship because they are not happy.
but they still want to have intercourse with you.
i would never, ever pack my husband's bag!
it will happen for sure, that is, if you really love her.
it is not so simple with children.
most people do not believe in it until they experience it.
it is not bad if you laugh at yourself.
have a delightful day.
ask him if he would like to go somewhere with you.
i am also mexican, but not mixed.
i knew it was hard, but it is better for you.
it depends on how old you are.
she is not interested, or perhaps you came on too strong.
don't do something you'll regret later.
i don't know where to find him.
there are alot of other guys.
do you feel you need to doubt that?
i don't feel anything with them.
it is strange that someone so young is answering questions on here.
it will cost you three points per answer.
why does it matter to you?
if you want to have drinks, make sure it is byob.
you have to understand that marriage is not fun and games.
maybe their husbands are not good enough.
discover if he is being unfaithful to you.
have the two of you been spending time with your parents.
a woman wants an honest man.
nineteen, almost twenty years old. how old are you?
it is wet, interesting, and better if it is forbidden.
you can say it, but whether or not you mean it is what will be questioned.
he would not reconsider not using a condom.
he broke up with you because of what someone else said.
first of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
sometimes, yes. but you do not know if it is real love.
sometimes i think it is boring to be a good person all of the time.
the only step is to do this _num_ times a day at least.
just because you are in lkove with yourself, does not mean that you are gay, maybe a little narcissistic, but not gay.
and if he does not, then, render the consequences.
the reason that your are so jealous watching other couples is that you cannot get your own guy!
my grandmother tells this story better.
i made the right choice because i see him once in a while.
they forgot to bring some for me.
why did they not tell you.
unles the woman did not care if i slept with others.
the more you think about it, the more you want it.
you should ask the girl to be your date to the dance.
you should find a girl that shares the same interests that you do.
he has a small penis.
i am sorry, but that is disgusting.
please leave her, go on with your life.
i've heard of friends that start going out and find out they aren't ment to be.
nope, customer care took it off the answers. bummer.
it is a way of showing that she does not want to attract other men.
i do not know. if i were you, i would ask her whether or not she is interested in you.
be genuine and do as the first person said: earn some more money because it may be beneficial.
do you think she should ask the person?
yes, the buttocks of a man are important in whether or not he is attractive.
the frist kiss sent my head spinning.
he is not cheating.
i want to do the same to her.
unless they say you are back together, you are not.
do not appear to be attacking her weight or she will shut down and eat more.
it is incorrect that they said that women commit because of money.
is the a chance they would like eachother?
if you are being yourself and they do not like you, they do not deserve you.
your daughter should come first in all areas of your life.
then, he broke up with me after a few days.
a person who is present when you are happy and when you are sad.
do i leave or remain here?
cheer up. times will become better. trust me.
perhaps you become too attached after intercourse and it frightens men into leaving.
do not fall in love with him.
where do you live?
you will be her backup.
even though it might hurt, do what is right.
some women like to please their man so that nobody else has to do it.
you are creating the issues with him.
i think your best bet is playing hard to get.
then again there are the homophobics.
i want respect and i want him to be nice to me.
anyone who doesn't understand, is probably brainwashed.
i stopped a kid from jaywalking across the street in the rain.
i think it is very important.
you should ask him directly if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.
just be yourself, and if she doesn't appreciate you, move on.
i would say no. please be realistic, this is not a chat room.
you will find the one for you.
you do not have to kiss during sex, but you do have to have intercourse.
i belive you should rehome the cat, steam clean the carpets, furniture, bed linenes and then spray for ticks and fleas.
look the women in the eyes and do not look away.
he believes that she would not cheat on him, however, he is constantly thinking about it.
it depends on the situation.
hugging him was not the best solution.
stop letting your husband slack on his responsibilities.
you can fall in love in four months, it has happened to me.
i threw a banana at the screen, and then scratched my head, i'm just kidding.
go get a breast reduction, and you'll look great.
if they love each other, they will live together.
in the future, don't ask questions that reveal your ignorance of the subject.
my friend often teases me for who i am.
you should move on because time is of the essence.
you could ask her if she is currently having sex with anyone.
she does not want other peopel to gossip.
i made a mistake of proposing to her, and she accepted.
you will never know untill you try.
comgratulations to him and his bride.
it sounds like no, but what are you asking?
perhaps, but obviously not enough feelings for her to leave his wife.
all i know is i am with you, there.
i have my own opinions, also.
sex is serious, making love is fun.
pray for guidance as people will come and go in your life.
do not worry, love is not rare.
if he denies it, then he is not cheating.
i talked to him for two hours.
he is not only honest, he is honorable.
he broke up with me.
basically, tell him what you want - lead him to your solution.
be honest with yourself and respect who you are.
also the penis story.
you're not on a trashy talk show.
i'm aware that this is easier said than done.
if you fell in love with a woman, would you fall in love with her personality?
are you asking, how are you?
the world is full of terrible guys.
it is kind of awkward for him probably.
ifthat is so, then, why can it not make it?
life is great, that is the answer!
if he is doing it by choice, then, that should be questioned and watched very closely.
if anyone out there knows this guy, please email me, i miss him!
ask her whether or not she likes you.
do not go to your best friends house when he is around unless she is also there.
of course you should continue if you like him, why would you not?
do not spend a lot of money.
also, if you are not ready to become a mother then you need to start protecting yourself from becoming pregnant.
start from your wedding day.
forget text messaging him, just call him at home.
finally, don't listen to these women's advice.
you should give him his walking papers.
she may have left you just for your personality.
phone sex is an alternative from the original.
marry her, go to civil court.
whenever you see her, have her view the best of you.
if you're a woman, dress out and act like a lady.
i am pretty, or so men tell me.
they are not healthy to have around babies. they have diseases.
i think you should write him a note.
perhaps you should travel to the uk and find out.
i'm married, so i am knowledgable.
no, it will complicate a lot of things.
i don't know why you are asking me this.
if he makes you happy, and you make him happy then be together.
he is the one who does not love you!
i think that anyone younger than _num_ or _num_ years old, is a dolt.
that is how you know, it just comes to you.
if you do not want to, then stay with your sister.
are you a guy or a girl?
that was similar to my situation _num_ years ago.
if you want to show your appreciation, make if known that you think of them and that you care.
we are married, but she can not concieve a baby.
i would tell him, but he will not care.
it's the inside that's important.
perhaps she no longer boasts regarding him to her acquaintances, as before.
so he enjoys flirting, as well as attractive.
you enjoy spending time with him, yet you name him creepy?
heaven knows, let the people be.
please tell me the possibility to be pregnant in this situation.
there are hot and awesome guys who weight over _num_
take a hint, she doesn't want you.
a man can work from sun to sun but a woman's job is never done.
many men are, but all men are not.
you are a threat, but you do not know it, yet.
i would agree with _num_
of course i would go. i do not have to be a muslim to attend a muslim wedding.
you should try speaking to him, first.
please send me some more info if you need help.
sorry if i'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
yes, you can fall in love after _num_ months. it could be.
tell your friend to tell him you like him.
since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
you cannot take the baby back.
it is a beautiful thing to still have your innocence. do not feel bad about having it.
he needs an incentive, although, you should be the incentive. some men are rude.
another girl likes that same guy that i like. i feel like i do not stand a chance.
exactly like she did to you.
a woman wants everything from a man.
i am in junior high school and he is a junior in high school.
you could always ask him.
a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
you want to be yourself.
when you are both naked and in bed together.
it has to be your choice.
most of the time, i think about it and say, well, is it honestly my choice?
what is the opposite of above me?
how about all the women who cheat?
a lot of my friends' girlfriends have asked me a similar question.
i agree that man you were asking about was just terrible.
i know it doesn't feel great now, but you will get over him eventually.
whatever you do, be sure that you do not get caught up in their disagreements.
you have quite an ego.
are you kidding me?
if you are in love, you will never be bored - that is true love.
i do not want her to die.
please be careful when you do it.
would i put myself in danger or a friend or a stranger?
i would be dissapointed if i got that same kiss today.
none of us could think of anything better to do.
i want to befinished with work today and forever!
flirt with them and say you love them.
otherwise, it is just something that will eventually lead to love.
do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
we'd go for walks and she would whine.
no, because he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
either he loves you or he doesn't.
sounds to me like he's already got a girlfriend.
it is not boring to fall in love.
you put in almost all of your effort.
i am going to say yes.
i had a backyard wedding.
i do not think my bottom is like that of a chicken.
then i am sorry because you are probably stuck in the friend zone at most.
you mean he does not have a reason to hate you?
smart people aren't just a little too smart.
last saturday, i had to pretend to be a women several times.
i am not sure, but i think it is mixed.
never mind, it didn't work for me.
if you go down that road and leave him later, it would not be good.
if you are under _num_ and still in school, you do not want to have sex.
she will break up her current relationship and make a move.
give her one in front of everyone and see what she does.
he is getting married to a woman, correct?
maybe one day they will finally be convinced.
find someone who can make a cake, and there you go!
should i tell my boyfriend, that i have no interest in being around him?
why did you leave your home the first time?
leave him alone, and he will realize your value.
i do not like seeing a woman's ribs, though. my apologies to super models.
all i know is that i am not on the list.
because most men are liars.
women can be friends, but not men?
stop doing that if she is not asking you for any more.
if i tried it that way, i think i would be able to enter her.
what did you do in that class?
it is exciting, especially when he makes you feel the way that you do.
it would take you two months for you to get into the house for the poor.
just because you are not dating anyone and it seems like everyone else is, does not mean that there is anything the matter with you.
"lol" is short for "laughing out loud."
the more you give him, the more he will take.
i believe infatuation only means for months.
depend on the woman. if she likes your posterior, then she will take care of it.
you wouldn't want it just once.
men like many different things, i know men that like larger women, and some that do not.
make it look like you'd date her for another reason.
i am positive he will be satisfied.
inside pain. men are not strong, they are tough.
only if she is more attractive than me.
i want to help but i am too lazy to read it.
do not try to ignore or be calm.
it is better to wait until you are married because it hurts badly.
are you serious about your age because i am twenty-five.
you are not her type, and she is also not your type.
do not let him use you. think about yourself.
could you please elaborate and answer me?
the boy will become jealous that you like him and not me.
it should not matter if you truly like her.
the ones given from the heart come from out of the blue.
this girl at my school is nice.
please recommend me to any that you know of.
i do not want to offend any good men in the world.
my mother's boyfriend and i have disagreements often.
we are not becoming younger, and that is the adventure of life.
i have been socializing with a very attractive man and our relationship is progressing positively everyday.
i suggest standing on a chair or walking on stilts!
if you like sports, then play volleyball, basketball, or something similar.
i am the love of his life and he never cheat on me.
i apologize that i did not understand the point.
if you are too shy, try getting involved in things that she likes, even if you do not like it.
she will realize that he made a mistake when she see's how happy you are.
compliment him on his appearance.
the dresses may take you a month alone.
do it the same way you've demonstrated towards us!
your daughter is being irrational, and you should confront her about it.
he didn't take your feeling into account at all.
they will not be allowed into heaven.
it all depends on other factors, such as your mood.
i am a man, would you like to go out with me?
well, good luck, and i do hope that he catches on and he does help you out!
just roll with the punches, and just go with the flow.
you will need to sign in another one every single day with each other.
i only did this because i did not want to feel lonely.
i have a friend who shops at that store for the same reason!
you should stop and think about how that makes you look in front of his friends.
you should try to do a good deed every day.
you are absolutely correct that you did the right thing.
i haven't done that, but i'd either start laughing or get distracted.
i wouldn't want my wife to have an inappropriate affair.
you don't need every girl to like you, just one.
no matter what, stand your ground.
i know a lot of women in the philippines that met someone online and got married.
forget him if he is joking about liking you.
i cannot play with him for very long because we have three children under five years old.
my man has a good butt because he works out.
so to look at another woman, and to flirt with another woman is deemed a sinister act?
you sister may have a suitable solution for you problem.
i have a problem with myself.
it isn't necessary, but it is incredibly helpful.
if you have no feelings for him anymore, it is very apparent.
i believe that _num_ need to have a conversation with your cousin.
i believe that it would be popular.
both women and men are different.
i know a lot of men who act decent.
a girl who has a promiscuous mind set, but is not herself, promiscuous.
they could not stay away from eachother for long.
it will change when you are older.
are you attractive and stylish?
you are living in a fantasy, not reality.
thoughts that come to mind while i go to bed.
don't marry that woman, she is manipulating you.
most of the woman on campus really don't like him.
people are nervous about that, but i am happy i married him.
in my father's world, there was my mother.
do not ever be gullible enough to believe such drivel.
there are some rather attractive fifty-year-old men, but why not search for younger men?
the female you are partial towards will be alone, and she states that that is less than desirable.
then, he attempted suicide, and my unintelligent self went to see him in the hospital.
kiss that man in front of that woman.
one) if you date beneath you, you will marry beneath you.
this really depends on her.
a woman can be pretty no matter what her size is.
she is going to find out if we go to bed together.
if he still wants to only be friends.
she is promiscuous because she wants men.
then you can do whatever you like.
sometimes a smart woman could go for a man who is not as smart as her.
you can not do the thing you are asking about.
there are many guys that are no so honest.
do you use yahoo! chat rooms?
just be yourself, confident and honest. you will see if it meant to be.
that is the best way you can find out.
and i mean this in the friendliest way possible.
actually falling in love is very nice, until you become aware of reality.
there is no better way than to tell him frankly, but tenderly as well.
thirty is relatively young to be getting heavier.
as a male, i think it relates to sex.
is he into sex toys?
be concerned when he sees someone else.
so what should i do for her?
hi _num_, it's not just for lovers.
when you are truly in love, you would do anything and everything for that person!
well, it depends on if you still have feelings for her.
do not pretend to be someone else.
you will not get a positive responce.
just casually put it out there.
love is caring for someone what you will never forget.
that song is stuck in my head.
tell him how you feel, and if he still cannot find the time blow him off.
it is hard to avoid.
turn ons are a hairy chest and chin.
if i did not have children, i would die for the one i love.
he is nice, but i have to question his thinking skills.
when you know her mind you will know everything.
i would say it is ninty percent yes and ten percent no.
there is nothing wrong with it. does he join in with you? i would say that if it was three together that would be interesting, otherwise, no.
what type of girlfriend is she? you are attempting to fix the trust, how so?
i know that quitting the school team was a good decision.
or do you actually love me?
i hope it all works out, whether finding your love, or dating someone new.
if you don't find him trustworthy, then how can you two love each other?
there is still a sense of hope for these young women.
you're just confused, and are not sure what you want in life now.
i am sorry but my intuition tells me no.
however he ignores me when i send him a message.
if it is scary it is not love and i hope you meet the right one soon.
no, i do not think that it is geeky or odd!
open your mouth and say something!
he is about _num_ stronger than an average man.
if you love him so much, then please do.
get out, and get on with your life.
that was an incredibly hard feeling.
i just met my first love again, we talked to each other openly about guilt, which is great for gifts.
as they say, there is someone for everyone.
i bet you will get him, so good luck.
i cannot because i am starting to fall in love.
you can decide so maybe stop giving in and having sex.
he may be sensitive or just waiting for the right one to come along.
my friend is interested in a man who said he would like to get to know her better.
and you do not need special shoes.
what? did he say "hold on, i do not love you, i was mistaken"?
i do not think so. be good.
if they love you, then they will accept you no matter what you do.
you definitely did the morally correct thing.
approach her and say, "i like you very much. do you like me?"
why can you not do it?
but i guess you could always try it if it is worth it to you.
if he needs to kill himself to get over this then so be it.
keep quiet so you do not hurt his feelings.
if you cannot do that, then maybe you can email him.
i am humbly (and laughingly) stating that i have all the qualities you have mentioned.
inform him bluntly that it is more preferably to hurt the other person now rather than later.
alas, it does not concern you.
he genuinely has a massive partiality towards you.
she favors dyeing her hair various colors.
i believe females do it as well.
do you marry a woman that gives oral sex?
i had a vision that you will get married as soon as you decide to do so.
some men are like that.
it does not pay to be narrow minded as god does not care about sexual proclivities.
when i saw that word for the first time, my friend told me what it meant.
why can she not see it even if we all do?
do not have children if you want to participate in coitus for more than five minutes.
why not approach her and ask her?
how can i deal with this situation?
do you know how i overcame it?
try to ask without any euphemisms.
men, does this sound familiar to you?
try it. you might enjoy not being sexually aroused.
whatever it is that you are saying is correct.
tell her not to see any bad men.
it is personality that makes women happy.
you did not mention whether your wife has children.
a few hours ago a woman offered to let me spend the night in her home.
tell him that you love him.
i dislike wearing flats. i will not do it simply to make a man feel better.
you have to want to let go and move on, or you will not be able to.
be yourself. keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together.
no, but it would be funny, because i am _num_ _num_".
no matter how long it will take to them go.
if he still does not want to, just try to be his friend.
does he care about relatable subjects or not?
guys are hunters, like dogs. but what they really want is the chase, so i suggest you run.
he wants you to do this so he feels comfortable messing around.
i have had boyfriends enough though i wear glasses.
women attracted to other women is not unique. some nourish it, while others allow it to fade over time.
i do not. although, homer simpson is attractive.
i'm aware. i stated that previously.
men think with their penises and it does get boring.
you cannot stop thinking about the person you love.
because we only get felatios four times a week!
thank you for helping to plan my wedding!
yes, women love it when you are obtuse.
tell him what you want.
what gets you more jealous?
you did not tell your age. is there any way to ask him to marry you first and to then think about children?
it is when she infrequently has sex with you.
god is happy when two people love one another, regardless of their sex.
if she is fine with her appearance, you should support her.
i will take it, unless i find out i do not really want it.
i would help her if i knew who she was.
try not to be too set on getting serious.
do you think he will do it again?
someone will be there for your good and bad moments.
if i go, should i expect anything from my boyfriend?
do we get free lunch or fireworks?
you will never have contact with him if you do not reach out to him now.
good looking gentlemen are usually vain.
they are, at most, five years older than you.
either one works; i guess it depends on the day and our moods.
in yahoo! chat, i communicate quite a bit in that forum.
you lose it if you do not use it.
i do not know how to feel about that, it is not appealing.
save the heartbreak, and find you a nice guy.
i did quit and joined a recreational team. i had more fun.
if he is married, you should not even be friends with him.
if she asks me and i do not know the answer.
and yes, i have a lot of chances!
well, i can sympathize. i am in the same situation right now.
just stay the course long enough so he knows you are not flighty.
if she plays mind games, you need to move on to someone else.
do you hear yourself?
i guess it depends on whether you have ever committed a felony.
yes, but i have not met the right person that i would die for.
a woman should like you for you.
i believe it is normal to do it on the phone as well.
do you actually mean that?
i married a handsome, but mean guy. eventually, we divorced.
obesity is the killer of young people.
he says that you do not love him because you have only called him twice.
tell him that it is over.
pity does not work.
my boyfriend is similar to a government mule when he farts and belches.
my friend claims she loves me.
live life to the fullest.
hang out with them.
do it if you love him.
maybe not for anything but for the thrill!
our family hated that it was an interracial relationship. my father and great grandmother on his side were angry.
before all of that go get flowers and surprise her with them.
please do not try that; your life could end.
just be more passionate with him and he will be yours.
i hope i was of some help.
no, i do not care about my boyfriends.
seducing a woman is a great feeling and an achievement.
i personally do not really focus on how a man's bottom looks.
you do not, and you just go on with life pretending that you do.
when one hurts you you will have another to fall back on.
do not be afraid to tell him what you want.
men like a little mystery in a woman.
there is one less piece of evidence that two people like each other without sex.
if it happens during sex, she isn't a virgin.
the problem is, i am not sure if she feels the same for me.
if he loves you, he would care even if it is just a petty problem.
first of all, that man didn't do anything to you.
he could not have noticed that.
not really, do you still love him?
this is how my wife keeps my attention.
tell her to get a life.
what can we do for fun after school?
the world is going to end because you ask daft questions like this one is.
post script, i am not criticizing or labeling you.
do not text and ask, that is faltering.
my man loves me and i hope that your man loves you.
it would look funny, but as long as you two love each other.
perhaps he just does not feel like talking.
if it is against your religion, then i am sorry, but i do not know what to tell you.
i do not know who you met.
do not make yourself sound so repulsive and promiscuous. married men are unavailable.
you just started a large problem.
some people need some motivation.
both of you should be understanding and able to adjust.
you want a decent man. here i am.
it seems that something is having a negative effect on you but don't worry because it will work out.
the meaning of this development is that she is interested in you.
in the vast majority of cases, he is not comfortable wearing the outfits that you like on him.
you might feel better if you tried thinking about another lady.
boys are more but they hide it because they do not want to look feminine.
i need someone i can really love.
what are you saying because it sees you know nothing about women.
you do not know her style so do not buy a woman clothes unless she picks them out.
if you show her that you love her, and trust her, then , she will love you all the more for it!
i heard some people say that if were to ask god for forgiveness for loving the opposite sex, then, you will be able to enter into heaven in the afterlife.
just admit that she does not want to go out with you.
your past should not be the thing to stand in your way if you girl trusts and is in love with you.
yes, men are stronger physically, i will give you that.
so how do i go about telling them?
stop asking questions like, "how do i get girls to like me?"!
well, there could be a reason for this kind of behavior.
list as many as you want.
in time you should know the answer to that.
i have been married three times and have two sons.
nobody knows. it is ultimately your decision.
if you want to know, then ask her.
always remember that there are plenty of fish in the sea.
you should go on a date with a guy you like.
are you asking him if he still finds you attractive?
i learned it in school and i am excellent at problem solving.
he seems to be a mean person.
i like the first one but i am _num_ years old so call me.
it makes the phone slimy and smelling bad.
your mom has no say over your life now that she has kicked you out.
do not allow if if you do not want it, even if he never admits to it.
it is scary because you risk your heart when you put it in the hands of someone else.
yes and it can last forever if you work at it and just grow with it.
if you are married, it is pleasurable, pleasant, and you live for that.
if you want to cry, cry while talking to her.
it is human nature to want to be loved.
if you discover the answer, please send me an email.
she would leave if she did not love you, correct?
if you wait too long, by the time you are ready most women will think that it is strange.
enjoy life, you live only once.
has there ever been a woman who you're attracted to, although not enough to be with?
his answer is great.
i did. we're still together two and a half years later.
i believe he didn't, because he feels terrible.
you should be careful, sir, lest you get into trouble.
sometimes you must let men know your preferences.
it is also good, and i invested in a food business there.
there is a girl in my shool to whom i am somehwhat attracted.
you are coming across as odd and must stop texting her.
who is gwen stefani's husband?
walking will help to lose some weight.
we've been communicating for four to five months.
what are you waiting for? go after him!
a girl is testing you when she looks towards you.
as a guy, i know what you should do.
it would be better if it was a chess cake.
i would not want him to.
become intoxicated with him and shed your clothes.
in your eyes, what makes a woman sexy?
certain people are unable to exist without it and others are able to.
correct, so head to that location and examine the surroundings.
it isn't a negative item.
it must be an element contained in the water!
isn't exactly relevant regarding his height, it's concerning the depth of your feelings.
if you claim to be manly, act like a gentleman.
i do not know about love.
they loved each other since ten years ago.
it can hurt, but it is what it was meant to be.
boys want to become men and men desire women.
which, of course, angered me greatly.
first, simply embrace him, then look into his eyes and say "i love you" and his name.
you have a right to date as well as to proceed with your life.
an age difference of nine years is not bad.
if she loves him, she will wait.
it is not for you.
_num_, jj, and i go to school with him.
observe his how he acts.
men like to date younger women, i am not dating a woman my age.
maybe his wife doesn't initiate intercourse as she did in the past.
make her realize that she is too important to you and that you are someone who she can love very much.
smile before you look away so the woman does not think you find her unattractive.
i am intelligent, but i do not think i am intelligent enough for him.
that means you enjoy seeing yourself.
i hate to say so, but it will become worse after you get married.
however, if that is not the case then he was not worth the trouble.
you could post an ad in the washington post.
are the two of you married as yet?
at that point, they might come after you or it was just not meant to happen.
you have become another "booty call".
i enjoy watching a woman masturbate, and after she is done, i directly have intercourse with her.
i do not want to be annoying.
at least i would because it is cost free.
why are men stronger, tougher, and more honest, responsible, and hardworking?
i go out of my way for a married man.
i see her terribly upset, what can we do?
bu i don't have a lot of money for fancy clothes, flowers, lots of food and all the other wedding stuff.
i speak idiot, gruntinees and jabberwocky, maybe i can help. pm me.
what's so hard to understand? the guy just wanted to get into your pants.
everyone is self conscious about some part of their appearance.
have a conversation in a non-accusing tone?
i think it is a good thing, try the product before you purchase it.
he has tried to be with someone romantically, but he just can't do it.
would you like to witness my hard drive?
why was he imprisoned?
tell your family that, that person makes you happy.
you are still a child, just be patient.
you should approach them first.
if i met the woman of my dreams, she would have to be everything i need.
it is alright for you to like him even if others do not.
why is it that men lie so much?
tell that person that you do not want to have sex.
it is better to say "let's stop".
you shouldn't second guess your actions together, if you both consent to it.
i gave my soul away to a one-sided love.
i wish i had the answer.
touch him intimately while he is playing.
admittedly, we are simple humans, while others are rather strange.
there is no way to acquire that information.
it could just be a strong emotion, not love.
i had one date with this man, who seemed nice when i spoke to him on the phone.
i am a _num_ year old man that has never had intercourse with a woman.
tell her you've been there, and he gave you a sexually transmitted infection.
do it for your man.
have them take a good lie detector test.
please hel pem. this is a problem.
they are a big part of your life.
when he screams, "where is my razor?".
you should go to him and explain your doubts.
yes, as long as you enjoy him.
i still know a woman who is looking for a boyfriend.
it will be painful either way.
do not be unintelligent; strive to be above average.
i recommend renting everything and having a family member take photos and recordings.
trust me, you will regret it later in life.
i think that _num_ or _num_ is a good age.
i am shy and scared.
it would not be good if he was dating a girl in junior high.
you shoudld try and act like you do not want it.
love is not all bad.
do not simply hand it to her.
that is not the case provided you are both adults.
if you ask for her telephone number and she does not give it to you, she does not like you.
tell the person that you love her in any event.
if he does not provide a direct answer or acts evasively, you know what you must do.
how long have you been with her?
if hse ignors you, she is not worth your time.
if he likes her, he should not be mad.
you need either a marraige counselor or a bigger bed.
you acn meet people in clubs and groups.
spend time with your friends and let yourself be around other guys.
did he volunteer the information or did you catch him?
go out and have a good time with your friends.
i love my wife very much.
oh yeah, a great sense of humor, good-natured and self confidence.
holy grail my friend, i wish i knew.
is having intercourse with your boyfriend something normal?
i have learned that if a guy really likes you, he will show it.
okay, been there, done that sweetie.
i have too much to live for to give up on my life.
who or what can i turn to for help?
i think you should tell him that you must respect your best friend and that he should respect you.
for a date, you should take him to a good bar where you can play darts and pool.
you are mature and attractive enough.

then you can do these activities together.
give me your input, because i dislike valentine's day.
be genuine and enjoy whatever you like.
no, only if you also want your friend to watch.
we have phone sex ever day, i never grow tired of it.
no, but it can make it a lot worse!
treat him just like you would treat a good friend that you have not seen in a long time.
if you are her true friend, you will not even consider it.
i have almost reached the point where i no longer care about giving it a shot.
no, however, if you are in love, sex is a totally different experience.
losers do not usually like other losers.

i don't see anything wrong with the two of you not wanting to have intercourse.
would you be upset to fin your future husband cheating on you?
i have seen your album, have i not? i like famous singers.
if he loves her, then why not?
why can you not simply ask her on a date?
take ideas from the knot website.
i suggest you move on.
except for that, there's nothing to suggest you shouldn't date him.
break up with him immediately.
is it really wise to marry a man accused of two attempted murders?
then you'll know if or when your feelings change.
briefly tell your story and hope that i can help you a lot.
he did not love you if all he wanted was to kiss.
i know my ex did the same to me.
for the long term that is good, but not for the short term.

i feel that they should get married at this time.
my girlfriend is crazy about the bottom thing.

men don't like being told what to do.
want to come sit on my cock?

mam, would you like to speak about what's occurring?
why do the women there possess facial hair?
i understand items can be lost, memories are more difficult.
reconsider questioning your elder sister again.
surprise her with it, then bequeath presents during supper.
no, he knows that we are not acquainted with one another.
i am very much so, in my darling's eyes.
it is only worth it if both of you can wait.
i used to be that way, but, not anymore.
you will never get any peace of mind having him around you.
forget about him. do not go out of your way to make him believe you are over him.
i hope not, i have enough trouble with homosexuals checking me out.
it means she likely would not have left you if you would have calmed down back then.
maybe you married the wrong man?
yes, but i hope i never have to.
women want it more and men are saying no.
you do not want to spend the rest of your life wondering what if.
you can somewhere else with your boyfriend when you have time.
sex is one of the most important things a man can do in his life, and it feels great.
if you knew that you might try to become that.

a great kisser is nice, but so is great sex!
my friend has no idea how hurt she has left me.
you have to be straight forward.
if he loved you, he would not have wanted you to have an abortion.
if you are in love, you should get on a plane and elope.
you need to relax for a while.
i have never dated a guy who does not have a great body.
what a tangled web we weave, when first, we practice to deceive.
why do you not ask him to go out?
i personally would want my daughter to be a lesbian, because i know what men are like.
then it would not be breaking the law, because you will be holding her for ransom, instead of dating her.
ask a question. you might receive an answer rather than points.

i guess i do not really get too concerned about it.
he is an inspiration but though i want to get close i do not want to get involved so please help.
also, the muslim question is amusing.
i am certain that is what a man would want.
i have the same idea with wrestling.
it is not your fault that they are weak-minded.
did you happen to like doing it?
then, ask him to hang out if they do.

just be yourself honey if you want to be observed as girlfriend material.

just ask about it, if you cannot tell on your own.

because they feel as though their husbands do not need them.
always obey your instincts.
open it and ask her the way you did here.
i am unaware of that specifically.
think of where her favorite places are.
none of the above, ask my about any type of man, and i have an answer for you.
i don't want to sound rude, but it sounds as if he may have a problem with commitment.
i am having a terrible day as well.
