knock that bastard upside his head.
you need to get a job if you asking questions like that.

but everytime i get back its the same crap over again.
if she likes you then she should know that your new at it.
yes you should, give him his walking papers.
i asked her to dance and we are now friends.
call her and tell her how much you love her
u r jus experiencing new things which is a gud thing.
no everything everyone else said is true also.
if you dont use it, you lose it
someone else might take the opportunity.........don't be late.
yes it is but are you in love?
but he tells me that they dont mean anything to him.
have someone else tell him for you.
he must have been a friend at one time.

a question that left you busting up laughing
don't marry that girl at all, she is using you.
good luck buddy you will need it.
no, don't ask him, instead push his buttons so that he asks you out.
and look at pictures of guys.
he wants a break, your boring him or he's haviing sex with someone else
please ,don't do this,you deserve nmore.you can but don't.
i dunno cuz me and my fiance are like that to.
love her, trust her, she will love u all the more for it.
im soooooooooooo loud we got complaints from our neighbors... no joke
well he wont be married much longer.
i have same idea with westling
you will know....you will feel it!!!
yes it is the french that everyone was using...but this also works...
so if you find the answer let me know.
other than that, there should be no reason why you shouldn't go out with him.
listen to your mind and heart.
jealousy is a heck of a demon to fight.
i think it would be cool.
honey, trust me i am a guy.
and definitely consider asking ur older sis again.

he got waaaay too many girl friends help me im confused!!
i believe being with someone is the best!
or, one day, slap him with a kiss!
i want to get back with him so bad.
at least he wants you involved in it!
seducing a woman it's a great feeling, an achievment.
tell him to go to hell!!!!
buy her a rose bouquet for v-day and ask her out.
you don't actually have to ask her to be your girlfriend.
if he is hot and you really like him, i would but that's my opinion know you decide
if it's during sex she's not a virgin!
_num_@hotmail.com add me and we talk this subject later
not even free lunch or fireworks.
i just like to get some advice.
look you just have to be normal.
how can i go and talk to her??
don't text and ask, that's lame!!
just don't go overboard with all your planning!
afterall she has lived her life all these days jus _num_ u...
and this is the first time i ever had to do anything like this for anyone..please help me!
no...why can't a guy talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
i was chatting wit a guy _num_ hrs.
you are such green minded people!!!
that jus means u like to see ur self
no matter what stand up for your self.
the same reason most women are stupid!
don't try that , plz your life will be ended
i want to so bad but i don't just want to do it.
if its a different one each week i doubt it... but check the signs: eye contack and flirting
sweetie, love conquers all...what are you so worried about?
trust me i am a relationship dr.
if i like a guy i ask him out before another girl out him out.
but that takes time to develope.
remember bill gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
god is happy when _num_ people love each other- regardless of their sex.
men want ladies out in public, and sluts at home in the bedroom.
dunno, cook him dinner, show him u care.
well ask him or ask ur friends that know him and they might know.
take a hint, she doesn't want you.
ain't the size kiddo, it's how u use it.
no i don't care about my boyfriend's.
go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it...
youhave some work to do there.
what can i do with her for fun after school?
have a serious talk with and tell her that it is childish and you are getting older.
we are better liers than guys are...
they end up thinking you`re a total bastard.
then see if he still wants to be around.
you just cannot force yourself on anyone or you will not have anyone.
but don't be like are you a virgin.
well i think you should introduce your self.
i'll try anything once and again if i like it
as for what to do... dont do anything.
older as in _num_ - _num_ yrs so he's alot matured
do you really want to spend the rest of you life with someone like that.
i say.... that whatever your instinct tells you is happening....is happening.
don't be dumb and stupid, be average in intelligence.
beside now this days its hard to find a virgin!
its basically deciding who i want to marry.
both is nice...just depending on what kinda mood/or day we are all having =)...
he lies to me and hangs up in my face.
and just do it, if yo wait you will never get anywhere.
is he ruining his life or what?
nope, but who is really happy anyway?
what do you like bieng asked?
everything reminds me of him and wat used to be.
here i expect he will go to jail even though you say it was mutual.
i can fall in love after one month.
if u dont trust him then how can he loves u or u love him.
why my ex b/f keeps tryin to make me jealous..
whats the worst thing they can say?
rent everything and have one of your family members take pictures and recordings.
she might do it agin oh and thanks i'll let him know.
i guess i don't really get too concerned about it.
r u and ur spouse still together?
you might not like it but pretend to.
find some barry white stuff, it works.
then you don't have a relationship.
i am a _num_ yo female.
but to much of a good thing can turn in to a bother.
and u just wanna be urself.
if u want to cry while talking to her cry.
it's about the one you're with.
become a friend to a women first.
if i got that same kiss today i'd be very dissapointed.
my love... aka my girlfriend aka my everything aka shes perfect...
friends are hard to come by..
i know my ex did me the same way.
so i guess a little of both
be yourself and see what happens
anger makes you say you can't hurt me anymore!
go and have ur breast treated and get them reduced and look sexy
that you aint getting none homie
i wouldnt dump my girl over those i have gotten nude pics from.
don't run he is just talking.
cheat on you then write a note.
let him be, he's not for you, he's giving you bad advice.
i see him once in a while and i made the right decision.
a _num_ year old guy tht never had intercourse with any girl!
well it depends on if you have feelings for her still.
stop having sex with him which you should not be doing in the first place....
it is ok to like him even though others do not.
he even slept with his best friends wife.
they r so beautiful and lovely
and what does it stands for?
who can put me back together
unless your best friend is suggesting this to you i say no way.
dont care about them just leave them cz trust me u wont get anywhere with these people
my problem is, i always see others as the way i want to see them...
and the only reason i did that is because i didnt want to feel lonely.
iam sure they think the same thing about girls.
not all gals, but some do.
if they dodge the question and/or get angry then i would be worried.
listen, if he loved you to begin with he wouldn't of wanted you to have an abortion!
what did he say 'oh hang on, i don't love you, i was mistaken.
if i could arrange the alphabet i would put u next to i.
why do men lie so much?
if she wants to play mind games its time to move on to the next luv interest
shower, wear deodorant & always have fresh breath...
try looking someplace besides the losers section.
don't do something u'll regret later!
marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
i have been to a few.
i have gone out with big guys.
i don't think most guys are stupid.
well mine is _num_ to _num_ inchs
when a girl likes u, u should be able to kno help me girls!!!
you know what you want, don't you?
if he says bye to you, he was not meant to be.
haven't you seen the paris hilton video yet?!!?!
i need somebody that i can really care for
both of u should be understanding and be able to adjust.
like peach fuzz is ok, but not hairy like a mens chest can get.
let your family know that person makes you happy.
if she's fine w/her apperance, u shld support her.
um...i didn't...i let the man come to me and ask me out!
the guy is married for god's sake!
tell them you love them, and see if they tell you back
you have ever right to be mad
do you really want someone that doesn't know what he wants?
my friends can't stand him and constantly picks on him.
you are the scum of the earth!!!
but, to make this person stay with u is a dificult part.
so just go ahead and text!!
i say right on to being a virgin it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
ok he is _num_-_num_ and you are how old??
happy u r. mature and attractive enough.
don't ya love it when a man does that s-hit?
and it cant be all hairy.
find someone who wants there future with you!
he loves you for being his only!
he probably thinks it's a good thing.
turn offs: bad breath, body odor and farting and belching a lot.
boohoo for me because i still think of him.
ask him to hang out with you, then start moving in on him and see how he responds.
different times for different ladies, chump
trust me you can't change them!
in no way do you need him or anyone bring you down.
i know he loves me even more because i was still a virgin on our wedding night!
if you truly feel in love, you should get on a plane and elope with them.
looking at a masturbated woman is enjoyable, after she finish it i will directly have sex with her
you shoud tell her how you feel
women can be friends, but men can't....................
just be a cool guy, don`t take girls for granted.
somewhere inside yourself you are strong and that will make him weak!
or shell break it off to make a move.
if so how many years have you been married?
ask him if he likes your kids if he dont thin brack up beceas family comes _num_
maybe my mother, but that's another story!
would i pack my husband's bags?
ive actually heard alot of guys say that thye prefer virgins.
and you have a problem with this?
i dont live there so couldnt tell ya sorry
if you are with an unsaved (sinner) you are a sinner too.
go to movies, sight seeings etc.
so we always meet and i feel like him.
tell her there's something you've been wanting to tell her.
if i wanted it, i wouldnt only want it once.
he did it one time he do it again????????????
then u distract her and bail out!
i care about him a lot, and i miss him.
if its something you enjoy then whats wrong with that?
but i hope not, i have enough trouble with gays making googley eyes at me on earth.
my friend told me that she really loves me.
she might have an underlieing factor that makes her eat this much ?
hey guys, does this sound familiar to you?
they just want to be loved
i want her, to want me....
our family hated the fact that it was a interraisal relasionsip my father and his grandmother lost it .
i mean beauty is skin deep!
because red is blody color but we sey blue is love
be honest ....with him, and yourself,do you really want him back?
you urinate from there, and don't even wipe!
u better leave his a$$ u can do bad all by yoself!!
dat was bad....... never again tv will be on during sex.
u will prove to be a great sis!!!
then one day he started flirting with me.
because the boys get gelles that you like hin not me
its so natural, why make issue out it?
repeat donot tell him face to face.
and to top it all off, i didn't get to come, cuz that headboard thing lost the whole mood.
but oops.. now i really love my wife very much.
if they do, then ask him to hang out.
i am _num_ and i waited until i was married to have sex.
do they feel like he doesn't have confidence or something
he wouldn't think twice about not using a condom).
do you think she'll know that you like her without telling her?
i can't caz i m on the way to love.
yeah, because chicks love it when you're obtuse.
a person is there when u are happy and when u are sad.
then you can do these things together!
it's simple.... just don't do it.
if you have tried to hard!
a man can work from sun to sun, but a womens job is never done!
because that description surely screams flirting!!!!!!
the girl you like is going to be alone and she says that sucks.
i like him but..im not in love with him.
i doesnt matter if u do it right!
cauze if you never give it a chance u will never know what would had happen between yall _num_
don't be afraid to tell him what you want!!!
...you're starting to hate the male/female friends of the one you love.
but u know how i overcame it???
love isn't bad...you should try it...
some guy was following me in a store and said i never liked levi's jeans until now, i ran.
and dear as i believe sex is to b done to give satisfaction not to get.. unselfishly.
tell her if she loved you she would come over and fuck your brains out and swallow your kids
kinda like suicide... normal to think about, but not to do.
my guy friends all say confidnece (not arrogance though) is sexy.
if he loves you, he'd care even it's just a petty things.
i cant stop thinking about him.
get ideas off of the knot website.
what is your problem your aready maried!
he will ask you to marry him.
they want a man just to be himself, at least i do
then you can do whatever you like
the ones just out of the blue are truely given from the heart!!
yeah, the woman i love is worth worth death, if she died i wouldn't want to be alive anyway.
if he doesn't, kick his butt.
i know he wouldn't want me to either!
girl, don't tell him you want to make love to him!
when he starts seeing someone else
as far as the love thing i dont know.
iam humbly stating....i have all the above qualities...hahaha!!
well, like i wouldn't necessarily just drop my friend like just because we fight.
that is where i talk alot in yahoo chat for my state.
get used to guys that just want to use you.
hook up with math geeks, they know how to handle curves :-)
a not circumcised penis is pretty nasty!!!!
you wake up and one day just know.
i'm married, trust me i know.
no but you should take care of it before you try to get preganant
if he is trying to control you - get out!!
i don't know about you but i don't like the bad boy type.
if they love you they will accept you no matter what!
god doesn't care, love is love.
thats not very fair to the guy your seeing now.
i hate those kind so remember money can buy lots of things apart from class, style and grace
depends on the size of the penis
it that true i tryed taking to him but he wont return my calls.
my guy has an awesome butt because he works out.
i wouldn't doubt him, just maybe.
try raising yourself.. he is not oblige to feed you!!
if all you want is to be with him, stay with him.
and just ask him, it might be awkward but it will be worth it if he does love you.
if ur in bangalore i am here :)
always happy...waking up this morning...at work now.
you need to ask yourself if you like him!
stop doing this then if she is not willing
but i've learned that if a guy really likes you, he'll show it.
then you will no her if or when your feelings change.
i have guy friends that are like brothers to me and there's no tension whatsoever.
or like what you did for class....?
i don't know...if i were you, i'd ask her whether or not she likes you
i mean.how insensitive of her to do those things infront of you!!duh?
i am always into the a-hole guys, whats my problem?
last recourse, cling and pray to jehovah god and to his son jesus christ!
hang around with her,go shopping if she likes it,.
i garantee that all the girls that think they think about sex a lot have no effin idea.
that will cost you _num_ points per answer :)
i think its a big myth that guys are just big, retarded sex fiends.
leave him alone he got what he wanted and maybe don't want to talk to you anymore
i need advice from other ppl.
sending money is not better, your kid wants you there!!
dont jsut wait for something good to happen.
we are married but still she cant conceive...pls advise..
my wife said it just depends on her mood at the time
twice first one i met and wanted to marry right then, the second is still unravelling.
i know alot just email me and i will tell you
you said it yourself hes in love with another lady!
believe in yourself...it is very sexy!
because there head is not on their shoulders!
but try to stay out of this till time makes them calm;) good luck
many men are totally happy just keep sex interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it
otherwise if you slowly appproach...her body language will let you know
a lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
i don't really even like the word stupid .
depends on how old are you
if you love others, they will love you back
him asking you out is up to him, you blew it.
i think you should tell him that you have to respect your best friend and he should respect you.
you get out what you put in (no pun intended)
i guess it depends.... have you ever committed a felony?
how much success you get in your life and you find love is the reason for that success
pretend to be a girl looking for a nsa relationship and im him..:p
because when you are into a relationship, and if you go out for fun... this kills your partner.
all i really want is my ex to realize that i only want him.
dam thatz a real hard feelin.
some guys really dont like any playing with their bums.
most people don't believe in it until they fall, and fall hard.
don't you really mean, how many minutes into the first date????
not all guys care only about sex.
well there may b some reason _num_ such a kind of behaviour .
i dont think i have a chicken butt.
no, i'm a girl, i only think about sex if i'm realy in love of some guy
if he has friends though then maybe he likes you.
i am not sure but if you find mine, let me know cause i want it back.
he already cheated your cousin and i think he will cheat in you some other time.
u r not considered unless u do it back in return.
i miss him.... if anyone out there know this guy please email me.........
i mean, because what's a relationship if you can't talk to each other about stuff like that?
i don't think it's a sin, but it surely ends in fornication!!!
but if you decide to go for it....have fun!
it sounds like you're more hung up on virginity than most guys would be.
i loved my boyfren of _num_ years.
boy, what an eye opener for me.
or what do you think about marriage?
can i get custody even though he has been a stay at home dad?
i think you got a boyfriend.
they're happy, so it could work for you too!
they used to be best friends, but now they arent.
but we never got together, because i was with his best friend *matt.
he even accepted my newborne daughter as his own.
don't spend a lot of money.
well then recognize what you dont want to
or if you're too shy, get involved in things she likes, even if you hate it.
sounds a little fishy to me...think she's got something to hide??
all depends on so many factors, such as mood...
most guys, as you probably know, are horny all of the time.
are u matuer enough to handle a serious relationship?
give her one in front of everybody and see what she does
did you just read what you wrote.
nobody can do it better than you
in the meanwhile continue to flirt, care or adore him and better still know him!!
most of tha time i think about it and say well is it realy my choice !
no matter how long it will take to let them go.
i can lend you a few!!
should i break up with her or go with it and trust that she really loves me ?
tell her while in a middle of a conversation to surprise her
i dont believe that love dies so fast.
i like him but i don't know if he likes me.
but i may whant it more then guys.
shall we say, put urself in there shoes.
what the hell should i do?
everything, a woman wants everything from a man!!!
hit me up if u want more... digital_lyricist at yahoo dot com.
dude same here.. but i don't think its a bad choice...
she's realised what shes thrown away, and can see how happy you are.
only _num_, the first and the last
because once you cross the friendship line it's really hard to go back to that!
the admiration s not enough reason to kiss
if it hurts, and the woman can't take it, it's way to long.
you can't train 'em to put the toilet seat down and you sure can't change their minds!
he just wants you to do this so he will feel comfortable messing around as well!
doesn't mean he's puttin' the moves on elsewhere but i would be suspicious !
no, i am not soft, just trying to be fair.
it's a way _num_ show u that she doesnt want _num_ attract any other guys..
yes he is a man that is what we do!
i gave him a second chance but he didnt take.
he will get jealous and when he does tell him that you dont like how he does that too!
may-b you become clingy after sex and it scares men away.
honey, if you don't want to have sex with a guy, that's o.k.
why would you care, as long as you got yours...right?
i guess things can get lost but memories... well is little harder to get rid of them ;)
hello how are you?what you neam?i just want friend in amsterdam please send to me sincarely shaba
its probably that woman don't like wussies!
im not sure but you have to be careful.
some men just don't function the same.
be yourself and if they dont like you for that they dont deserve you
if he/she really made u happy u would be glad to sayback off not flirt.
it's very easy just buy him a flower and say that you love him
not really, do you still love him?
keep your boyfriend, but find a lover!
since you mom kicked you out, she has no say anymore.
it's the only thing real serious ladies are serious about.
lol i supposed you've tried talking to him?
if he want to just be friends , it's best to move on.
don't let anybody ever tell you different.
if they r not, why would be so mean?
if u have an he still continues to do it then let him go u dont need that!!
hugging him was probably not the best solution, lol.
yeah, but i haven't met the right person which i would die for yet.
i am really mature so don't mess with me!
and why did they not tell you.
one was wolf the other a very large lab
but send the ole boy a post card from bora bora or something.
you are going to find someone else and wonder why you forgave this guy so many times!
well if you wanna meet some hot mama citas i would go to the library or maybe walmart.
yeah its possible...it happens a lot to me
and you really want him to ask you to marry him
when a girl looks at you, she is testing you.
thanks for helping plan my wedding!
the more that you keep giving him the more he is gonna take.
you should try it some time you will not be dissapointed
get a younger guy for god's sake.
no, drop dead girl who dumped me....i even won't give a damn to her anymore....
isn't it torture for one and ego for the other ...
it really depends on the situation...
i believe a woman should make her own decission.
secret admirier notes,with clues leading up to you
any guy that's not completely desperate won't ask you out again if you dumped him.
plz tell me the possiability to be pregnant in this satuation
then tell him that if he's interested, u could go out sometime.
a compromise position is to refuse to hang out with her when she's been drinking.
i found out my gf was really a boy.
just be friendly not fwd i.e.
hey guy, i've seen you on a cd, havent i, and i like famous singers!
life is like that, everyone hurting each other.
they got to be in the mood for love and let it all go!!!
i would tell him straight up,he probably won't care anyway.
we've been talkin _num_ _num_ mnths.
hope you get some new friens soon...
!lol when i went out there i noticed that too.
no, but that is because guys have different horomones than girls do.
oh not to mention a cute a$$ and small boobies ( ya as weird as it is!
how im gonna handle to stop being a jealous girlfriend?
if along time you should no the answer to that .
its not your fault they are very weak minded .
where does the baby's daddy fit in?
why would he go to jail?
the phrase to use is, hey, i got enuff friends
you won't meet anyone too serious unless you got a big dick.
as long as that person says it's ok.
my friend had no idea how she ruined me.
just move on with your life and find someone else.
guys can have female friends too -
i`m sure he will be happy.
stare at that for a bit.
pity doesn,t get you into these panties.
is having sex with your boyfriend something normal?
but it does not do anything with you.
you should make the first move
who knows it's all up to you in the end.
nope.unless they actually said we're back on, then nope.
she's not interested, or maybe you came on too strong.
no i don't think that it's weird or geeky!!
you can't stop thinking about the person youre inn love with
your a _num_ year old woman you should look for someone your around age
as they get married they syart acting stupid and abusive.
i would think that he is having sex with someone eles.
it just depends on how it is.
i'm a boy, wanna go out with me?
hi _num_, it's not just for lovers.
now, would i put myself in danger for a friend or stranger...?
what was this all about, i'm curious now?
you try to take it slow, no guy like to hear that he is a bad kisser.
it cant be done,if they care about you its going to hurt no matter how you say it.
we get to know eachother better
the boy is _num_-_num_ years old and he likes me.
it might be hard, but try to act like you don't want it.
so just make sure she knows how much you love her.
what are indications of a man flirting?
you ask her and she should honestly tell you.
flirt with him/her and tell her you ove her/him
move on - time is essence
when he screams where's my razor?
it means she probably wouldn't have left you if you would have chilled out back then.
dump him...your wasting your time if you stay with him
and neither of us could think of anything better to do!
my sister has dumbed him since then but she is pregnant with his baby.
get her things that actually mean something.
when she not asking you for any, any more!
oh forgot a big one for you ladies.....ever use the sample cosmetics at the mall?
there is still hope for these young girls
don't say that because most guys arent stupid.
yet i will not date a large man.
no, i know jim he is.
when she slacks off sleeping with you !
dont give him sex for a while - make him go nuts!
but why would he ignore me??
then, i learned that he likes me.
i get hungry twice a day.
just ask her she'll probably like you to have some help
in places where there are black men...duh!
by the way, all those commercials saying, condoms don't always protect, well, something is better than nothing!!
can u check it out for me plz die fast
she might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around, etc., but she can't fake that.
but this really depends on her.
but only when theyare in the mood or if you spice the moment.
best revenge: move on with your life and forget that the cheater ever existed.
be loyaly and nice and friendly and sweet!
keep it that way no matter how mad she gets.
sometimes it dosnt matter if you no how to use it.
we try to make females comfortable.
and that he has a tiny wiener.
what kind of girlfriend is she?..ur trying to fix the trust, how?
especially if your used to having sex on a regular basis.
cuz they have a one track mind
u can tell him anytime.he'll probably do that if he isn't gay
have i told... you lately that your cuuuuuuuuuuuutee!
the world is going to end just becuase you ask stupid questions like this one.
they actually have younger brains than we do.
not love, but who knows right?
and hes not a druggie or nothing like that.
any man who doesnt like kids is a coward to responsibility !!
just look around u. i beleive this is hell and heaven.
whatevr u r saing is very right.
i got to read what you got but thanks for the ideas
just have fun or keep yourself busy.
only if u feel like u need a boyfriend.
guys are hunters like dogs that like the hunt but the chase is really what they are after...so run...run...run
how can i tell if the man im with truely loves me
ur question is making ppl able to know that u r single.
or im just scared or shy!
but be extra careful, you're playing with fire!
it hinders u from doing fun thigns with people.
yes, i guess i like the thugish type of guys.
girl, it's not going to last, go out and have fun!
undress yourself infront of him u will know
if you know any, please recommend me, thanks
at least that way i'd get into her.
no one knows this girls intentions if she really loves him she will wait.
ive asked her to be my girl friend _num_ times already but she never answers.
it's all the inside that matters
do married woman still givee head?
but it has to be up to you.
but i will expect her to do the same..so just get with better guys....
if you can't take it to be his friend then leave him alone
yes, and it can last forever if you work at it and grow with it.
do things that makes you happy.
really good looking men tend to be vain.
i just broke up with my gf but its harder to get another one can u help me
my dad is like that too.
im pretty or so guys tell me.
she knew i was there & i love her.
she really looks up to u and thinks of you as a friend and probly nothing more
?i think infatuation is only for months...
i think it depends on hwo mature the child is.
does anybody know what love is any more.
unless i found out i didn't really want it.
everyone wants the perfect guy but no one seems to be willing to be one.
only if she's twice your age.
who is more important to you??
she knows she has to move on but she can't....any ideas that might help her out?
good luck and i hope he catches on and asks you out!
there is no way to know
it does not mean good things for you as far as dating her goes.
but hes as clueless as i am.
this is a major no, no!
you didnot tell your age ,any way ask him to marry you first then think about kids
depends on if you are a girl too or not.
ank one other thing, trust her.
unless if you like being treated like poop.
it is never boring it's actually fulfilling
im _num_ years old.im almost handsome.
you don't know what real problems are until you get married and have kids!
and why do the girls there have facial hair?
no they cant because somewhere deep down there is a attraction,,,,,,,,
okay, so he likes to flirt and he's good looking.
where do i go for help?
a girl who loves him and cares about him.
if this guy says no he won't help.
chear up..things will get better,,trust me..
you are young ....you need to talk to your mom about that...
keep quiet why hurt his feelings
unless they really want it as much as you do.
my girlfriend is crazy about this butt thing.
mabie you married the wrong guy ?
_num_ a guy cheats you are hanging out with the wrong men.
guy: im a caveman girl:whats this?
if you love him so so much then please do
i would have to agree with _num_
oh, and as good as it may sound, dont do anything for valentines day!
but smart peeps aren't a lil too smart.
she or he will get it.
relax, do it and think that's not the best point in your life.
so thats ur answer yes they say that wont cheat....
and crying is ok....but talking is more productive.
it means they love you and want u back
i also like kids...but i'm not one.
u are making issues with him.
no dear its not a good idea untill and unless u get a perfect partner
no phisical contact, no eyes contact, no hand contact, just the faith that the other one says the truth...
till him that you love him
if a guy/gal can't be honest with you then forget him/her!!!!
but sometimes he acts like he still does.
have u cheated on her in the past?
if ur hot also comment on her hair,outfit,or her shoes.
well if a guy does that to me, i just move on.
depends on the man of course!
you just answered your own question.
if you feel like he is chancers are he is.
to show their apreciation and to make it known that they think of you and they care for u.
_num_ months if you want to go in the poor house.
dont stick with someone who isnt right for you, its just not worth it.
mayb its cuz ur doin something wrong!!
get rid of anything having to do with him
especially if u are looking to get married and settle down.
if you have money to spend, girls usually love jewelry!!
the least she could say is no.
trust me u'll get asked out soon enough.
no, i think you cant spell.
one get divorced...duh two, prove other lady is a stupid ho, then ur done...
it's cool that you like this girl.
you dont know... that's why they call it love (confusin aint it)
because after all i'm in your school.
i understand that u feel as though shes not as attractive, but shes happy bout the way she feels.
now if you can't say this to his face scream it in the mirror with him not around...know why?
and you already had sex with this man.
beause they dont think with the head on their sholders.
this guy and i got really close this past few weeks.
just like most of the time guys dont understand girls.
i think you just lust for him.
never mind, i tried it doesn't work.
then it wont be breaking the law because youll be holding her for ransom instead of dating her
the way she reponds will tell you if she right for you or not.
i think its a good thing.... to try the milk before you buy the cow .....
something that happened behind your back.
if my sister's friend shit on me i would leave the room immediately!
never buy a women lingere unless it is something she wants.
how to check that i am madly in love with her ...?
try to smile before you look away so you don't make the girl think you think shes ugly :)
well, if he only kind of likes her then he shouldn't get too mad.
first of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
what ever you decide.. quit giving in and having sex
first of all she,s not much of a best friend, keep your eye on her.
maybe because you are differant than every one else!
get with somone more in tune with your maturity level
well, i feel you on this one, cuz i'm goin thru the same thing right now.
they don't do anything for me....
i see her terribly upset - what can we do?
and take a good look in the mirror.
but now he ignores me again.
go out with your mates and have a great time!
try saying what if we got married one day?
go to the gym - workout practice speaking with a lower your voice be confident
try a card if you cant just say i love you
because all men love to compete.
lot thoughts coming while going to bed.
also tell him you had a bad experience with another guy that tried some stuff and made you mad.
god moves in many ways ?
don't have sex w/ him and see what he does...haha great advice i know!
you never have to ask... look him in the eyes..see to his heart and soul and you will know...
of course way would u ask me that question that means your _num_
he needs to see what it's like firsthand.
what would be a good gift for a girl i like but she doesnt know
i actually prefer hispanic men above all!
what about trust when things get tough?
if he has money and isnt a kreep stay!
ur spellings tell how worried u r.
if you connect with someone, just don't worry about other people's feeling's... dr checko... (nickname)
who is gwen stefani married to?
call and say hello and be done with it one way or another
this is the love most people seek, yet are to lazy to earn it.
people don't do things they don't get something out of.
a girl can be pretty no matter what size she is.
i've got this friend and she's going gaga over this guy who doesn't like her back.
lets talk on yahoo shrunkenmann_thegrass (_num_ girls only)
not a bad person at all!!
dude, i dunno how you feel about that, but umm... yuck.
nope customer care took it off of the answers......bummer

honestly, i like guys that haven't been with a lot of other girls.
get some cool electronics out of the deal.
go upto him n speak out yr doubts
i kind of ruined jons friendship with matt.
maybe even try to hook him up with a friend!
always listen to your gut feeling.
ur probably so d*mn ugly he has no choice but to look.
dont pretend to act like something else!
dont ever ever fall for that garbage.
if ha can't respect you then he's got to go!!
can _num_ here speak clear english?
post an ad in washington post

yes because almost all men are like that
that bullshit...maybe u just got some issues with asian women...
it makes the phone all slimy and it smells funny.
and walking will take some of this weight off.
i know quitting the school team was a good decision.
tell your man, to tell him that u don't like that guy.
why is he sleeping out with the dog?
idk y r u askin me
i knew it is hard but is better for you.
wouldn't she leave if she didn't love you?
but this girl i really do love.
i hate to say it, but its going to get worse once you're married.
i am an old fashioned kind of guy.
oh, um, well it depends on your relationship.
and of course stop & say hey!
you dont want to lose him as a friend.
simply because u only put _num_ of ur effort.
we think we are giving them signals but they dont get it.
if these don't work out, leave things as they were, and start anew in a different direction!
i like the woman to be loud though!
just wanting to meet friends in amsterdam
only if she's hotter than me.
u are surfing the net..yahoo answers obviously!
im telling you this from personal experience.
of course it's da feelings that count..
do u mean how are u?
i know, it's easier said than done.
stop thinking about looks and start looking at people on how they treat u
if he gets too possesive send him packing.
if you have back pain, get a breast reduction.
just be yourself and like the first guy said, a little money wont hurt anyone.
hey, i am _num_ and just got a girl friend.
it's just the way of life
i will say wait till she's ready to wear a bra.
asking him if he still finds you disirable?
he will b pleasently suprised and will luv all the more for it:)
why don't you just email him your question?
dont push her or tell her you love her.
you sneeky bugger..i was just going to ask this question.
something unique and not ridiculously pricey?
yes it is beneficial to not have sex.
never can be if ur a teen or kid or something........
what in gods name are you doing.
there not the kind of guy you want.
if you like a man talk to him and get to know him
i heard once it was not.
u are just jealous of those other people holding hands and making out because you can't get a guy!!!
maebi that's just hu he is.
dont tell him first, go to your mom or school social worker and let them talk to your parents.
your damb right you did the right thing!
hook/ kiss up with the guy in front of that girl.
are they sick or wonderful.plz elaborate and answer me
anytime he says come here , there you go right behind him.
tell him to leave her alone.he should be looking for another one.
she was kind of this outcast punk rocker chich with big blue eyes.
as soon as they get mad beacause you wont have sex with them, dump them.
its not bad, but it does look kind of funny if the girl is significantly taller
if its against your religion, then sry, i dont know wut to tell you.
yeah your mom is going out with him
ya the dark hair, dark eyes, and skin...they are rumored to have nice butts too!
wow.... what a situation..... good luck with that!
stop asking questions like 'how do i get girls to like me !!!!!!
i personally dont really focus on a guys butt.
he really haz a big crush on you!
i got a labrador n luv him a lot!).
but its really hard to avoid!
nope but if your in love sex is a totaly differant experiance.
the best town is ur imagination because if thats all you want you will never get anything

so how do i approch a woman and ask her to come home with me and my b/f?
umm..prolly because you're single and couldn't get a date??
u should ask a person u trust or a doctor.
so should i tell my man that i don't like being around him?
first get drenched in the rain and tell ur man to carry u and get cozy
maybe shes playinhg hard to get or she really likes u n dousnt admit it.
just ask him if he would mind if you sent such pics.
_num_ my _num_ time (& last) time having sex while watching telivision.
and stop letting your hubby be such a slacker!
talk to me-- you can't be that lonely !!
it means that u've got a new little sister!
or if i see you with another girl, i'll rip her bloody arms off.
if u like sports play vball or bball or whatever!
if you cant to the time [haveing a baby] then dont do the crime [haveing sex]
i mean insider pain, man are not strong they are tough.
but even if, she's still ur friend.
its simple that u should take her out for dating .
some guys that have experience don't know which way is up.
just ask her if she ever have sex with anyone.
oh, also tell your man why u hated him.
instinctly, i'm going to say yes.
if not no if your to young like _num_ and younger then no.
i like this one guy *jon & he used to like me too.
one might b good n bed, the other a listener!
men are beautiful no matter what.
and yes ive got lots of chances!
sounds like he might have found another way to please himself
you can't really expect to give him anything too pricey!
a girl that has a sluty mind set but isnt one u know
don't spend a lot of money.
as a guy, i know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..
why don't you let the crapola pile up?
it really depends how ugly she is.
i think not, unless your trying to commit suicide?
unless you absolutley love it i would say no!
and when she does, all she dreams about is him.
soap if you smell better maybe.....
well, that's how i see it anyway....
or you can say hey wanna sexy want to go for a soda, just kidding.
another girl likes the guy that i do, and i feel like i don't stand a chance.
hmmm, a little vague on the informastion giving.
and me im also mexican but not mixed.
believe that you will find your true love someday... just have faith...
of course cause i wouldn't be able to live with her death
she already knows it not love.
who cares wha their gender is.
not special, not weird... just your personal choice.
it's time to move on...maybe it hurts but that's life.
rather say, whos on yer mind...
party it up while your young.
you really come off as quite creepy...oh ya, stop texting her!!
yeah... if i was trying to get out of the relationship
?i promise i won't bring my friends along!...
i'd only get upset if the guy staring is ugly!
if you are not growing and having fun, then the relationship is dead.
!are you some kind of schizoprinia?
because we make them nervous and their brains jus go out the window!
cause we only get blown _num_ times a week!
heck no, i'm a guy, and i wouldn't care if she masturbated infront of me, i would enjoy it.
believe wat u want _num_ blive.
why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that way?
most boys try to be ignorant with girls they like.
ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
it would look funny, but as long as u _num_ luv each other.
it will pay off in the long run.
what the hell does that mean?
or just my guy ego cant handle a girl knowin about it !
he used to mentally and physically abuse me.
if he does that means he really cares for you.
babe, he is the one who doesn't love you!!
any chance they'd like each other as well?
most guys aren't really stupid, you're just meeting the wrong people.
this wedding is not about you, period.
we have phone sex everyday, never get tired of it.
do something that most people haven't.
perhaps she doesn't brag about him to her friends the way she used to.
have your fun now when you are single.
you shouldnt get with your cousin.
sometimes you have to show guys what you like!
yeah it depends on how long you've been chatting.
here is not the place to find one
boys want to become men and men want women.
trust ur humor, beauty, intelligence, relation with other, how u conenct... and the like.
i wouldnt want or need anyone else.
theres this hella hot guy in my neighberhood.
either he loves you or he doesn't...
if you get the real answer here my email teshtad@yahoo.com
is not bad, if you like him.
and you might have already scared her.
not only men have them, women can too
marry her and go to the court.
see what gets you more heated up.
find me for alot of fun!
you have become just another 'booty call'!!!
look out your window because there i am
first kiss send my head spining for a few second.
some men do and some men don't....
i think 'no answer' is your answer, you just don't want to admit it.
women want it slow......and take too long for it......men want it without a tease.
give him a bl*w job once in a while.
maybe he's just checkin' if you're alright.
if you ask him i dont think he would lie to you.
give me your input because i hate valentine's day.
get rid of cat,steam clean carpet,furniture,bed linen, spray for ticks&fleas
if he did, he wouldn't have even looked at the other girl.
dump him hes oviously not interested
you have to take a stand.
what can we do...put a ad in the local paper...
asking this cuz is like it is always guys that is ready and up for sex..
and also the penis story as well.lol
i'm sorry dude, but that's disgusting.
hey broo if you're not live in miami area you better get your ass here this is the best........
if you like her ask her out and see where it takes you
i don't, but homer simpson is hot!
tell him that you are a beautiful vampire ;))
astrology is a bunch of bunk.
when you find your gem hopefully he'll want you for you
i went to one where they had a belly dancer instead...lame!
no one can control their dream.
maybe that is why it is called fantazys
or, you could always ask him.
he not into toys or anything freaky.
do crazy stuff like cover yourselves in whipped cream or something tasty.
good luck!...i bet you get him!
don't let her play games with you.
and tell them how sad you are.
some can't live without it and others can.
friend, spouse, or even your family members.
but yes it could work if you want it to!
i'm _num_ you serious about your age????????
is it just too weird and geeky!
she a player all she wants is a boy toy
also for older kid, try putt putt golf, laser tag, go-karts, that kind of thing.
if that doesn't work tell him that you have an std.
just let her know that it bothers you if she does not stop run!!!
know a lot of girls here in the philippines that met someone online and got married.
why dont you ask him out?
if being apart makes them happy then you should be happy for them
when he knows im not looking he will stare at a woman and check them out.
and he broke up with me.
you have a long history with him and you know the real him.
you are living in a fantasy
so that next day i went with my boyfriend out to eat to the place we were going to.
he doesn't like your kids, you don't like his?
if it's a chess cake, much better !!
show her she's important and not your stupid friends
if you can (and its about love), its probably good.
!and there are alot of other guys on this planet.
all of us can see it...why cant she?
we have flurted may times but i just don't know *_*
just them down and explain to them they should be understanding , and support u no matter what .
then of course there are many questions on wheather i've been f---ked up the a--.
start cutting him off now -- that way when you get married, he'll be used to it
and with protection u can start anytime.
how else could you be but straight forward?
i'd work with him some more.
i married my high school sweetheart's sister.
knocked up girls lose intrest that way.
got a good cast iron skillet?
u need to ask him directly, if he wants to spend the rest of his life with u.
i have gotten dates, not as many as if i played stupid.
he says he respects tht i wanna wait and undetrsatnds!!
what in the hell should i say??
don't be a wimpy, winey, wuss.
that's how life works... there will always be ups and downs in your life... just accept it.
if he is joking about liking you, then forget him!
as they say....there's someone for everyone!!!
he didn't love you, know how i know?
try watching an adult movie together.
what is a gurl to do?
get out!-(and then)-get on with your lives!
believe me, you do not mess with a friend's younger sister.
if he realy loves you than he wouldnt care if you have nothing to offer.
threaten him by saing ur going to call the police if he doesnt pay child support!
i agree with rockhead don't tell anyone
is that a question for a guy?
just talk to her and see if she does like you.
if you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
she never got over you the first time...
so how can i tell him?
how can i handle this situation????
depend on the girl if she likes your buutt she will take care of it
i'm just trying to avoid any quarrels... she gets jealous pretty easily!
you feel the best feeling uve ever felt in your whole life
i just wanna help her open up her eyes before something bad happens....
u can tell by the way they look at u and the way the person talks _num_ u
i start quiet and get louder and louder and then....baaaammmm!!
i've learned all kinds of things on here that i didn't know before.
jus tell her how you feel and why you love her
the one i had with your mom.
okay youre confusing _num_ question at a time.
im sure thats what a guy would want.
then see what she says, and you'll have your answer
i invested in a food business there... its pretty good also...
i'm just looking to spice things up in my room...what should i try?
every once in a while, i won't, just for a change.
to get over him just play with guys
so it's either get over him, or wait.
think about it in my opion dump this fellow?
sorry if i'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
if you are a boy then sure!
i never thought i would get asked out but i did.
if you are even asking this question, i think you are probably too young to be getting married.
not all married men cheat, i didn't when i was married, my wife was my life.
but you'll never catch a woman admitting to it!
who knows , and let the people alone
lol you juos laugh out loud and you should feel better
comunication but are you sure u wanna do that
tell ur partnner and undetstand him well, help ur self to help each other.
maybe one day they will be conviced.
talk this one out girl before you make a bigger mistake...
there no better way than tell him frankly, but tendly, sweetly ...
invite him for a dinner or movie!
mr nobody get drunk and kiss her that is how i did it three year ago.
say a prayer to help u guide the best possibilities.. people come and go in ur life.
have you two been hanging out with your parents?
no only if they are sick
probably not, but again, i don't think i would want him to.
and ask yourself if he is a decent person and is nice.
be friend and give him some timen space
and let your personality shine through and dont be fake, girls can sense that.
it's easy to say yes, but i have a feeling it would be tough to do.
dont take action, cuz she'llget hers eventually.
i am scared to ask him if he stills likes me, because i liked him too.
i guess people want what they can't have.
please, send me some more info if you need help ;-)
besides... do we really want our moms to be liars?
i dont think that girls are bad liars.
did you ask him what lead him to cheat?
it is better and easier to tell over the phone or in person.
with kids its not so simple.
because distance makes lies harder to hide.
lights off w/ very few candles and on top of the covers
then, he broke up with me after a few days!!!
love is caring for someone, or something that you would not forget.
you are still a kid wait
that means you can have your cake and eat it too!!!!
if he says no he's cheating.
dude, go back to lickin yer nuts.
nope are u a guy or girl?
at least i would.oh and its cost free!
if you only want your ex then leave the rest alone.
my husband and i moved in after _num_ weeks go _num_ it
its the same reason mine is.
some men just need a little extra stimulation to ... ahem, get the job done.
if you like him then of course you should continue, why wouldn't you?
what goes on in mens head???
yeah right he knows he dont know me!
even if he never admits it, dont allow it if you dont want it.
weeelllllllll......men think with their penis' and it gets bored.
it's d inside that makes us girls happy.
when youlike a guy who like you back
i know this is a lot to remember, but trust me!
remember that this guy needs to help pay for your expenses, too.
get him drunk and take off your clothes!
make love with a loved one .
would i date a stripper, probably not.
i dont like big tits! )
then jon asked me if id be jealous if he went out with this one girl *alyssa.
wat are you good at doing?
becaue my train of thought ran off the track and bumped all other men's off to
make them laugh and they'll love u.
one said, i can't leave my kids, the other said, why do you want to have coffee with me!
abbout _num_ to _num_ hunred is my gguess
hey be yourself if she dont like you then move on you are still young
he is a guy what do you expect
try it you might like not being horny!
hubby & i got married in july (_num_-_num_-_num_) and went to hawaii for _num_ weeks!
how do i get out of it?
i dont know... are you in love?
maybe you should not be worried at all.
if u are in luv u will never feel boared....thats true luv my frind.
why don't you get a job, and then you'll have money of your own.
well, if he makes you happy and you make him happy, then go for what you know!!!
i just want some good love songs to listen to i know it's kind of sappy but whatever
just tell him without having sex with him and you won't come over being cheap!
what if you're interested in a lady, but not sure if she is in you?
because once they are interested then the chase is over
doesnt mean he doesnt care about you.
and he can not notice that.........!!!!!!!!
because most of them are horny assholes that can't get any.
well how old are u and i would like to be ur friend
its all up to you.just dont look too hard.
don't ask let him say it on his own
that is just too much skin for me!!!!!!!
ya the moneys is great but there alot of stuff in those places .
you mite lose the one you love,to some- one else.
so you can lean from it
do i walk away or stay around????
first of all this is not the right age match the desires differ...so be careful
i laughed my ass off when i read it.
other than that, go to a party and hit on drunk chicks.
cause they think theryre popular and hott and they just are when it comes to dating
yes tell him the worst he will do is say no
)i want respect and i want him to be nice.
or whatever, he's a dumb guy anyway!
so wht to ddo you think!
my friend likes this guy and he said he would like to get to know her better.
good question i'm a girl so us girls will never know!
since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
but do you love somebody ?
stopped a kid from j walking / running accrost the street in the rain.
do not give into him easy it gives him to much control to fast.
it's odd that someone so young is on here answering questions...
you can have full intercourse... if you want....
don't let a man walk all over you.
did you catch him or did he volunteer the info.
do you really want to marry a guy in a trial for _num_ attempted murders???
u've gotta accept the sad truth.
if she's shy than probably she reaallyyy likes you.
to th extent of giving my soul away...but if its oneside love i wont do anythng!!!
have them take a lie detector test - a good one.
yeah i f****n hate this day too!!
even on silent he can see the missed calls.
wow thats really sad...were do you live???
do it in person though, set up a dinner date.
really though, they are just bad news.
phone sex is like an alternative from doing the real thing.
once u've talked to her then decide where u are going to live.
personally i dont think that that is useful.
she likes to dye her hair different colors
and your time and your life!
your guess is as good as mine.
ha ha, have a delightful day.
do it for your country man!
if it doesnt fit in the mouth
well it depends.. how old r u & how old is ur mom???
so how do i tell them?
some people are very ignorant thats all just be there for them
does he care about things relates to your not?
that has _num_ be the worst thing to do to your friend roght now!
good looks,good habbits & ofcourse a great figure makes a girl a good girlfrind
either way it's going to be painful.
is because nobody has done it to then so they dont know how it feels.
hey, what are you saying, seems you know nothing about women.
do you have a pic page or something.
start by saying i want to kiss you here (nose) then here (mouth) and here (cheek) then here (neck)!
if you are not married and have sex, its bloooody and hurrrty.
i wouldn't worry about the heroin.
i'm sorry if you love him (wait you said that you didn't) anywho, leave him please!
wellllll some guy's butts are cute.
beautiful girls can be found everywhere, just look around you!!
yeah, me _num_ and jj all go to his school.
people have lots of reasons why they have not found that right person.
he needs to grow up and mature
let her try on a sports bra.
i have been nothing but nice to her everyday....what should i do?
u broke up leave it _num_ him
that's the best way to find out.
as gab said...no way to know.
p.s.- the muslim question is funny.
if you watched spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off gaurd and just lay it on him
you shouldnt think that because then everyone will think u are stupid( like me.)
do they really love you or do they just say it.
they are just dreams you know.
turn ons: hairy chest and chin.
he's ignoring u for the same reasons we ignore you!
no contact whatsoever just a simple crush or do i have to get over it.
once by mistake i had proposed her and she had accepted.
what if the people were guys?
and i say this because its true.....its not the only thing.
different men like different things...i know guys that like big girls (i also know some that don't).
just tell her that you need a hug every once in a while.
don't just hand it to her.
maybe the both of you need time apart.
its coo when ur in like _num_ grade???
you tend to love the person more when you have sex
boys just want sincere and caring females who can accomodate them in life and nothing else
him nd i met through a friend(his bro.)
i advise u dont hold anything bak.
takes a lot of patience, i bet.
not necessary but it helps a lot!!!
& i told him yes very.
he's already got a girlfriend it sounds like.
no matter if your in a skirt and heals or a baggy pair of jeans.
he obviously is trying to hit another girl so i would back off.
just tell him to his face in a nice way, that its over.
i'd never pack my husband's bag!
move on and stalk someone else.
don't be dumb like i have been.
ya know i have the same problem, so i know what ya mean.
when my girlfriend bit my cock off and ate it
i wouldn't want my guy having lunch with some other lady on v-day!
obesty is the _num_ killer in young people now.
you do not find her it will just happen.
if only i knew the answer...
go to a very important (in her life) vacation resort
and she dont want other people to say anything.
im me now on yahoo messenger using my id :pao__num_
well just like me _num_ years ago.
so, he says you don't truly love him because you only called him twice??
i think its alot important .
please her in the bed room also.
i know a lot of decent guys.
just keep trying to find that special some one.
even though it's okay, your partner need not know everything you think about.
that's more exciting u know.shyness sucks.
yea i used to do it all the time
just put it out there casually.
wait, even now all thier stuff is bullshit.
sex plus friend does not always equal love to both men and women.
find a girl that share the same intrest you do
if you truly like this person, then why not give it a try?
just curious if any gurls have any advise about havin sex for the first time...
no only if you want your friend to watch too
being _num_ years old is pure hell isn't it??
you guys need a marriage counsellor or a bigger bed.
sex is like air & water.
o and trust me it can get bad!!!
it was about _num_ ago but they still really love each other.
and their friends will bad talk you to theirs and so on and so on
on state and federal grants (you don't have to pay grants back).
if youre talkin about here, the internet, that is a wrong place.
and you don’t need special shoes !
if he won't sit with you, then you know it's just friendship.
if he is unwilling to lick it then don't let him stick it.
first, who broke up with who?
adam and eve.... they were smart tho
wow, what an ego you have.
know anyone who can make a cake...there you go!
um o let me think noooo.get real this isnt a chat room
why can´t you just do it?
if he loves her why not?
tell him ur boss or just dump him and get anouther man in ur life
and then if you havent already, get you to a doctor!
very truly speaking, wether my friends agree or not, they cannot ever find a friend like me.
just say 'i love you' getting him/her off guard.
he always says sorry..but then a month later hes lying and being dishonest.
my boyfriend farts and belches like a government mule!
and if he likes you for your activities, start doing things that he wouldn't like.
you will always wonder if you never tell him the truth
it's fate that does that :)
love them because god loved you first.........
you should think it through very good.
i fell to my knees, i won't ever forget that weird moment.
listen to the song baby baby stay gone by jimmy wayne.
but i enjoy necking and even a little caressing.
first off, don't do anything you don't want to.
_num_) b - i married a handsome mean guy and i divorced him.
if you both can wait, then it's worth it.
leave him alone or you might be running into trouble.
love is not scary-if it scary =it not love you just haven't met the mrright yet so good luck
your rights are to date and go on!
your mom kicked the wrong person out.
okay, if you want it to be special, don't buy her etible panties!
its not even for you ..
don't push the ladies... they don't respond well.
well, yes, but i hope i never have to.
and we sat on my bed and looked in her eyes and huged her and kissed/made out with her
just wait... maybe its yet the time for you to meet the right one
either you get along with this person or you do not.
i'm not a prude at all, i love oral sex, porn, i'm good looking.
the waves in boracay normally dont get that big eventhough its raining...
you no longer want to see his/her face.
no not really but if you do f=get preganat your baby can be stillborn or have birthdefects
if your not hiding things, showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
don't go back out with her.
if gurls dont like u for that they have problems
wat do i do with both of them?
did his boss give him a hard time...?
best way is look straight into his eyes and u will get the answer
men like younger women and i am not going for a woman my age.
if killing himself is what it's going to take for him to get over this then so be it.
then.....he tried to kill himself and my stupid butt went to see him in the hospital.
p.s...not criticizing or labelling you at all!
don't blow it on a thing called sex.
but men are people to and have feelings just like us ladies do.
women are different, just like men are.
well it cna mean many differnt things.
yes dude, if you start lifting your a** off that chair!
just remember a man is stll a man.
many men are, but all men are not.
yes, at least mine do live.
if she is getting jealous then their must be a reason why.
strike _num_, he no like kids.
she did it once, shame on her.
if you like guys and girls, then you are bi.
i think a guy with a nice round butt is sexy.
if you're not planning to marry him, why bother?
depends on choice, but i like dog style too much..ok
well... if you like her guess it is ok.
start showin him more lovin attention!
i didn't believe till i saw her eyes.
i was _num_ that was _num_ months ago an im still with her.
you should have sex when you're horny.
unless the chick didn't care if i slept with other hoes.
first of all, the guy didn't do it to you.
not accusingly, but just a nice conversation?
my man loves me and i hope ur man loves u
come to romania with me, i already live there:)!
if you want to get married then do so.
she is the boss, and you had an intimate interlude with her -that is that.
i think he got didtent because he feels bad.
“i know he’s a jerk but he says he wants to be with me.”
if you are really her friend you won't even consider it!!
congratulation to him and his bride, she is lucky :-)
but you're probably too good for her anyway.
send a video of yourself having sex, it pays
it wouldn't matter how she looks.
i'm not sure even chickens care about it thats what
she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work.
if she is aromantic, get her some flowers and chocolate eventhough valentines day is over.
would u like to be called stupid?
i want to try and spice things up.
because if you're not, it will be dry sex and will hurt.
no, he just likes to talk to you
but if you think that this could lead you to a heartbreak then wait and watch what happens!!
it cant be love because you dont know anything about her!
ok been there done that sweetie.
why in the world would you do something like that and then go around telling it???
i hope all works whether it is finding your loved one or finding a new loved one.
but they dont have to be half naked.
and if you are not ready to becoming a mom, start prtecting yourself from getting pregnant...
sorry about that... don't fall for it again... save yourself the hurt
pick yourself up, don't let it bother you too much, and just have fun/play the field.
i think females do it too.
if she's really, really ugly, then yes - not having sex is very beneficial.
you will find the one that is for you.
with love will be full of sweet meanings
just like she did to you.
tell her that you love her and try to find money,,,,,,
maybe you should tell her and see what response you get.
my yahoo chat name used to be 'iscreamifyoudoitright'
when your boyfriend dose not im u or call u for _num_ weeks what would u do
this is how my wife keeps my attention!!
because they are not happy missing somthing from their relationship
to my bestsest friend (x infinity _num_) your friend forever i like cereal ^-^
it just depend on how old you are
its easy find someone to marry you in the jail
didnt know until know but hey herre's one for ya!
do it when you are married
your still going to feel you can not trust men.
but woman do talk about it alot!
hey, honey...do you wanna talk about what's going on?
when you cant get that person off your mind
then don't go back for him.
just look at her eyes and smile.
it means exactly what she says.
i am a gemini actually but honestly spiking i dnt bliv in horoscopes.
for some guys does it not always matter just about the sex?
yea my ex said the same thing once.
if all he wanted was to make-out with u, he didnt really love u!
you didnt say if your wife had children .
it is called, he's just not that into you.
you can do better, doll !
yeah but you get more horny than fall in love
he is a piece of shit and i never want to see him agen.
far enough to be away from family but close enough so they can visit maybe once a month?
when you can hear echother without speaking
yeah baby.. a girl knows what a irl wants right???
you know your in love if u have sex with them
why not get a job and send him money?
i can't help thinking, was it me?
what happens if the relationship does'nt work out?
act yourself; just keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together!
but according to me its unfair!
yes you can fall in love after _num_ mönths , it could be .
i got _num_: u judge for yrself.
do you have a chicken butt?
because men are so good at it we could not be compared !!
personality above all... then fit body (and not neccessarily thin) and kindness...
you can like who ever u like
admit it she doesnt wanna go out with u
jesus - why not poke every man's eyes out?
come on yaar its ok now.
yes get rid of the cat.
sounds like you are hot, so thats a good start!
first, choose only one guy, you love.
why in the world wouldn't a guy date a virgin?
i say think long and hard about it.
you'll never get any peace if you keep him around
(no offense to big butts, but it was a man).
u surely did the right thing!
i sure would like to talk to someone
like me my luv lives far away from me.
i think playing hard-to-get is your best bet!
i kinda like my guys thick.
send your ex a nice valentines day gift.
and when your hot like you are its worth it
because you're the only ten i see!
sex with my hunk ( i didn't have to share him)
tell him you don't want to marrie him and if he keeps it up run
your daughter comes first in all aspects of your life no matter what!
theres a mr right for every girl.
i made it and so can you.
yeah like lumbeeman said, have your bff tell him for you
do any other girls feel the same..?
if it's love, then he will wait and also not cheat on you
be young - have fun... don't take life so seriously.
a hard face _num_ go wit it.
yes get out of there quick
as long as u r true.true love u will find anywhere.
i think about sex non-stop, and even more than all of my guy friends.
(sung as off key as possible) silly songs are the way to go!
hold your head up and smile.
at the maximum _num_ years older than you.
just come in front of her and tell her that you are the man of her dreams!
so theres a lot more out there then what is happening right now.
even if they laugh at the time.
it did in my head lol.
we fall for girls of all shapes and sizes.....every guy is defferent
sure as long as you like him.
you're a fucking retard and if you were my kid you wouldn't be allowed to date.
i wanna help but i'm too lazy to read it
the rest is just window dressing.
find someone better, someone you deserve.
i've been hanging out with this really hott guy and we are getting closer and closer every day.
i love my ex with all my heart.
and stay away from the plants i mentioned.
if she likes you - great.
if its because you like someone else- say that.
have you ever heard of descriminating based on sexual orientation...and how that is wrong???
well it creeps me out but some people get intense pleasure from it...go figure
any person hu loves u shud think think about your feelings.
until then, quit being such a jerk.
she says that it doesnt mean anything and that is every guy's dream.
and you should be very respectable about it to.
are you sending him the wrong message?
you have to want to let go and move on or you won't be able to.
i can tell u that all girl think different.
what happend to his queen kong?
but that also depends on who you are??
but i guess you could always try it, is it worth it to you??
i don't know are u ready for one?
wanna have girl frnds or boy frnds?????
it isnt a sin = ) and you can go as far as you want.
if she asks me and i don't know the answer.
why don't you have a job?
but i really really like him
i told him how do you know i'm looking at you ????
would it bother him if you did were asking guys for pictures?
couldn't have been bad if they married anyway.
i'm telling you, it was long.
plus, women aren't just ready you need to help...
but if you have to ask you are probably too young or immature to really get married.
my mom's boyfriend and i always argue.
i'm a self-proclaimed nympho, but i dunno if i'm just really nasty or really horny... all the time.
the position they like the best is walking upright in the shopping mall with your money!!
actualy like few hours ago i kinda got offered to spend the night at a girls place i know..!
jus t tell them u already have a date sorry about that you should have asked earlier
stop thinking about what could be and dreaming.
my guess is you dont look the same to her either if you dont inspire her to inpress you.
looking back, i am not really sure why i did it!
i'm not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
to risky if you ask me(which you just did).
but if u really want to know just ask her.
who needs gud looks if he acts like a beast???
ask him if he'd like to go somewhere with you.
we get along great except this issue.
where do u get these stats?
if you don't like any of the guys that asked you out then just say no.
it's kind of weird for him probably.
im smart but i dont think im smart enough for him.
hasn't there ever been a girl who you liked alot but not liked enough to be with?
because if you go down that road and bail on him later, that would truly suck!
yes, like you are a complete stranger to me.
run like hell and never look back.
some say if they ask god for forgivness for being gay they will enter heaven...
i care for him a lot, but only as a friend.
learn how to spell cant understand your question
don't do something you would regret later.
he probably won't tell you, but he's most likely to tell _num_ else.
then i started smoking and drnking.
if u agree with him no prob but wot do u feel?
as thick as you want it.
and she just has this constant fear.
there are some great looking young _num_ year old men; but why not look for younger men!!
what's the opposite of above me?
it's not just a guy thing.
sweety, why can't you just ask her out?
she is nothing special to others, but she is my true love... that's all !!
ever heard of a pajama party????
or do you enjoy hurting those that mean so much to you.
my friend always teases for who i am!
heck no move one, been there done that sheet.
so i will tell you what alot of the guys i know dream of.
its not good to date them all
the same problem is with me
but once she leaves him karma goes around so it will go back to him.
don't let him see you down.
but, we are happy and enjoy life!
go out with him once and if u liked that date then duh stay with him
why their more exciting sports are the ones with a lot of contact?
no, seriously.. don't get him another dog!
sex with love of course... you have to love that person you are making love with... it`s really important...
its better to loose a lover than love a looser
if you asking this it means that you love your wife.
hun if ya want to be girlfriend materal be yourself.
no, because my breast to big
(read my q&a)...i was dating my new girls friend, n i dumped her.
i'm just his friend, i mean, i love him and as far as i know, he has no idea.
sex is one of the most important things a man can do in life and it feels greatttt
well that too in the same house where he is living right now...under angelina's nose!........cool huh?
if a black man breaks into my house is it fair to say most black people are criminals!
was i not attractive to him that night?
where a sexy outfit get yourself all pretty make him his fave dinner and then give him sex.
a woman wants an honest guy.
first and formost, for him just to say so shows the kind of man he really is.
if he did call it was atleast once a week.
women liking women is very common and some grow to like it more others let if fade over time.
i am cause if i wasnt then i'd be w. a girl lol!!
girls esp--- have u ever gone out with a guy u liked but dint really know?
oh yes, if you realy feel the need to..send him one too.
makes _num_ quick access i guess?
but women doesnt care it so much like mens do anyway.
or just excited about being in love?
hand the mofo a toilet brush.
theres no need to keep playin games.
first of all, that's not typical of a guy.
i would probably break up with him.
i for one dislike fake boobs.
what a tangled web you've woven...
whats so hard to understand?...the guy just wanted to get into your pants
don't give him too many chances.
-im just wondering- -thanks for answering-
if you guys dont have sex, then i dont see a problem.
get buck wild have sex anywhere and everywhere.
i believe that they will.why not?
or you really love that person, me?
arent u answering ur own q
we're not talking about flirting as in playing dumb.
enjoy life cause u live only once.
i say, look what you wearing.
and he thought i enjoyed myself.
i think that boys are more sensitive but girls show it more.
please leave her go on with your life.
love will find a way, if you guys really are meant to be...
i dont think u should give him any more times u dont wanna get hurt again
you can but do u really mean it??!
woman wants some challenge, not just a guy she can walk all over him.
well, just try to observe his action.
personally can't even think of going out with someone i gave the boot to bf.
holy grail my friend, wish i knew.
satisfy ur self but be careful use protection!!
just remember its up to you if u dont want to u dont have to!
it is not a bad thing.
have a good life, don't let him way you down.
as little as possible forgive and forget
if a guy didn't really care, he wouldn't give a damn.
all guys do it even when they're married
but lately he avoids me & wont even talk to me.
divorce is not something that kids like.
do a good deed every day!
start looking for someone more compatable and closer your age
no guy wants to be just friends with women.
lol do ya get it now?
from my on experince it depend's on the both of you.
maybe cause u sound so sorry
it's not all about how long, it's about how long and how thick!
i'm in my mid twenties and am still a virgin.
if it doesnt mean anything then y is she goin out w/ another gurl ?
give him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
if they love each other they will live together
oh yes you can.....where were you that day in sex ed?
believe me, sweetheart, people are not always who they first appear to be.
when you want to give him a bear hug everytime you see him
_num_ you hear that love song and all you think about is them.
is it coz he doesnt trust me?
u don't need to worry about that.
it kinda depends though when you are older
he'll find that with another, but you want something more, don't you?
try wallstreet :))..i mean stocks and all...
it seem's from your statement, your just hangin on to a dream... dr checko... (nickname)
so spill the beans and let it fall where it lands.
however i think stupid far excedes dumb.
y does the skin color matter??
you should definately tell her to wait.
then if he still wants to be friends only.
if you get tied up in mess your going to come out with mess.
make him think u have intrest in his best-friend
yes ya not and now that person seem to be a good frined
things like this are bad to do thru email
and if i got my ass dumped for it, i'd deserve it.
then it is up to her to listen or not and find out in the hard way or not
it is better to 'lets quit'
really tell her to think twice.
nah..you girls are just too paranoid in everything
and u tell him it's ur way or no way.
when me & matt first got together i really liked jon, & i didnt know he liked me too.
same reason why men do it!~ ^_^
dress like a decent lady and you will find nicer guys.
cos one way or another shes gonna find out if we got to bed together!
that's a stupid question to ask, if you don't know you never will.
yea u love him but u wanna risk him gettin sumthin an bringin it back ta u?
need alot of answers so shoot
if the guy treats you great, who cares what his butt is like.
they dont want to be your friend anymore?
they are a big part of your life too...
some men are scared of marige, and stuff so a good talk might help!
just remember alot of married men are very happy.
just assure her that mom/dad both love her very much even tho mom/dad don't live together anymore.
tell her you been there and he gave you crabs
say hi, then just have casual conversation with him.
i asked him if he still liked me & he said no.
youare no old in fact you need to do things that you like doing ?
no,becuase he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
no it s not noemal it is abnormal
dont force it because you might make a mistake.
if the guy doesn't like her, then advice to move on.
nobody will give you a positive responce
somebody is there for ur good and for ur bad moments.
see if she emails you back or find out in person.
flowers, not roses that might be too strong.
you two should be boinking like rabbits.
but if you hve to ask then you already know.
good things come to those who wait.
if your girl loves you to bits, then your past shouldn't stand in your way.
notiing wrong with this, does he join in also, i'd say if it's _num_ together thats cool, otherewise no
and its usually the one who is not as good in bed as the other.
dont try to impress her at all.just let her know that you like her
i lost my virginity at the age of _num_, i honestly didn't know what the hype was all about.
do you chat in yahoo chat rooms?
you dont like him, you like his friend,why not tell him?
i don't like seeing her ribs though, sorry supermodels.
why do married /committed men cheat?
what exactly do guys want from girls?
is sex soooooo good that people are willing to risk so much??
is sad how some people are..
but beware, if you wait too long, when you're ready most of girls will think it's wierd.
is it that you don't have one, or your ehaving trouble with the one you have?
be blunt... hey, you guys going to let me in on the conversation or what?
gather all ur girlfrends & have a party.. let her mingle w/new faces..
if you are _num_ and he's _num_, then thats not so bad.
if u wana attract ur husband's attention and #@$#)*)#)_*, then u gotta remember two words; food and sex.
you could find the most beatiful natural blonde and tall girl in this world but she wouldn't be smart!!
ask a question ya might get an anwser intead of just points
if u were to fall in love with a girl, would it be her: personality?
because trust me: later in life you will regret it!
just talk to him, stop wasting time!!
please try to remember this: the leading cause of divorce is getting married!!
and u kno wat he doin but u don't care cuz u let him tell ya different.
you dont even know how old he is???
yes u could fall in love after _num_ months trust me it happen to me
just say i love me too.
there is a girl in my school who i sort of have a crush on.
do you dream about her at night?
if that doesn't work, talk to a friend (not about him)!
i dont even talk to other guys.
lmao, great way to start the day, lol
a picnic lunch in a beatiful, quiet, private setting.
where is he working.. how many hours... ask him.
u know we do it too!
wow...well ive been in the situation.
ask her permission if in doubt!!
).....i am looking for virgin girl as i havent sex yet.
don't say to much stuff.say hi!!
then a personality that isn't too bad.
dont worry you should grow up and out of that
because they are an orgasm addict
i don't want her to die.
no but u can be so one's bi***
if you like him say yes if you dont say no
the world is full of fucking guys ...
odds are you wouldn't get married anyway so find someone new!
you need to sign another one every day with each other.
i think everybody has a right to enjoy my girlfriend doin stripping.. u r welcome to the party too.
but dont let it bother you.
unless it was a good dream, of course.
when the ache from the love consumes perhpas...
of course.i would go.i do not have to be a muslim to attend such a wedding!
save your heartbreak, find a nice guy.
you don't need all girls to like you--just one.
probably the flirting led you to beleive he did want more?
ask for her phone number... if she does not give it - then she does not like you.
for me a girl beein mature!
dump him, just because you love him ...doesn't mean he love you.
that would be none of your business !
but i have my own opinions too :p
lol is short for laughing out loud.
is it ok for me to have sex with my gf?
you never know, try flirting with girls...that helps
don't let some other girl get a chance with your crush.
(throws bananna at the screen and scratches head)..lol..just kidin.
i would hit it even if she was still dripping from his sex
do whats right and listen to your heart!!
ask her out on a casual date.
u cant get married in jail
then you have to ask hey!
first of all dont call then stupid and ugly because they like u.
gosh...i love my sister to death, but she always seems to put herself in unhealthy relationships.
go to iraq and keep in touch.
stand on a chair or walk on stilts!
no, it just like he loves exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
that you are the one and only..
most people don’t even get there.
try this, did this person have sex with their spouse before they got married?
what's so shameful sex is freakin' awesome!
just surprise him...... you can do it!
your story is like in tv series.
mayb thier hubbys are not good enough....
ok, i think its just nothing.
if you love someone it's because who the are not because the color of their skin
i did quit and joined a rec team and i had so much more fun.
the problem is that the girls that do smell.. think they don't.
were not getting any younger, that is the adveture in life.
when i catch him staring at a woman he denies it and yells at me.
you got that right .but have to do it any way .or she kill me.
whatever you do, just make sure you are not caught up in their fights.
only if u guyz r best friends
i want to be myself but not scare her away, what should i do?
(at least of course if you are over _num_!)
go out with ur ld friends to meet other new friends.
anyone who 'doesn't get it' is brainwashed.
not very sexy if you ask me.
all i know is i am with you there!
hmmm.....if u dont know then i wont tell you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im a boy i know what you should do
sex and candy where can i find you?
maybe she also got the same feeling as u are..............
i don't think he doesn't trust you.
sorry but no, get a job
why get married.... just become some ones biotch
well if u are really lookin for advice... don't do it...
don't let him use you ...and by that i mean - think about your self.
actually this sounds weird but try watching both kinds of porn one gay, one straight.
a woman married a dolphin, so why not
be yourself, be confident, and be honest... if it's not meant to be then so be it
it makes me feel good about myself when other guys hit on me and flirt with me.
i don't think so... behave yourself...
(i don't want to be mean) but it sounds like he may have some cheating issues.
i dont have my g/f wait on me.
of his life, and he would never cheat on me.
i tell my guy that i love him every day.
whana come sit in my cock pit!!
lights on and on top is sexy!
well, if she dumped you because you were just being you then.
i can't believe he is telling you.
most of all - have fun!
just means that they aren't playing games with their sexuality.
i love sex too and can't get enough of it.
i luv talking to him, it's like i don't feel real good unless i talk to him.
we're all a little screwy round here!
thats kool dude.. i still have a long way to go.. but thanks for this _num_ points.=d
you seem like a sweet person...you can find better!
guys like a little (not alot) mystery in a girl.
i praised my god for got her as my wife.
but thats not a bad thing if you enjoy it and its with a responsible person.
i just had a vision... you'll get married as soon as you decide to do so!
i think u should just write him a note
how old r u well that doesn't even matter run
honey just come right out and tell him about the phone call.
try some honesty, it works for me
he didn't think about u at all.
i know it sucks now but you'll get over him.
been married _num_ time and have two sons!!!
he is getting married to a women right?
ask her politely why u havent' heard from her for years.
you have been hanging around with the wrong women.
like he is really cute then what do you do then
then she will think you are really hiding something.
that is a lie if you really love the person your relationship will stay strong no matter what
or you could spred rumors about her where ever you are.
she does it again, shame on you.
you are doing the right thing just devorce him, and get back to your life.
then go ask her out,, :)
we have _num_ children under _num_, so it's not like i can play with him for very long.
they are not good to have around babies they have dieases.
hey doesnt everyone like theirself or @ least what they look like??
but you aren't really asking anything here.....
here's the answer that life is great!
once i just said, well, if there's nothing better to do .
where the heck do you live?
maybe he just doesn't feel like talking.
having younger friends will help make up think & feel younger =)
surprise her with it and give her little gifts during the dinner!
a boyfriend thats his friend to.
tell him your baby is in need of him
you get in life what you pay for.
but, still wants to have sex with you.
yes its ok, everyone is attracted to other people.
my grandmother tells this story better!
but yeah, guys do think about sex more than girls.
(you all know you were thinking it!!)
see how it goes from there
except that didn't end too great... :(
so what do u want to do now?
people dont care anymore about others.
get over yourself and go to that wedding!
my best friend is a guy and we have never tried to be more
what you need to do is get mad!!!
ask them wen theyre hooked up _num_ a lie detectotr
in my case though, it didn't!
you won't find love on the internet
ask the girl to go to the dance.
you can do alot of things.
lol.. what the heck are you waiting for... go after him duh!
play with his lil buddy while hes playing
how much does your balls sweat?
if you feel shy, just tell him to close his eyes.
if the boy has such an attitude of mind he's not worth ur love even if u r simple.
u need to talk to him about it and tell him to stop
well, why did you post such a stereotypical, dumb and pointless question?
your _num_ year already has a daddy
_num_, almost _num_ how old are you?
a girl should like you for who you are and nothing else!
come to henderson north carolina there is enough of them here
if you're already having sex with the guy anyway... best thing to do is have sex.
we're not mind readers you know...
some poeple just need a little push.
if that doesn't do it, then i'm stumped.
dude, i hate to say it but she was cheating on you with this guy before you broke up.
if she like the beach maybe a weekend in the bahamas.
well if you really love her, this will happen for sure.
don't even do that to yourself!!!
don't buy a women clothes unless she picks it out, you do not know what looks good on her.
just be patient dont' rush your self.
take it slow and you try to make it perfect.
games, games games, don't play them, you always loose.
and don't think you won't be getting pleasure from it.
jon & i used to be really close & talk all the time about anything & everything.
she might come clean to u if she doesn't want to be with u anymore.
tell your parents u love them and move on.
sorry i dont know where to find him...
dogs r like family(trust me i know.
what can i do to get her to lose weight?
they have lots of great suggestions on there.
never let anyone tell you different
yes, the butt is an important physical feature on a guy that makes him attractive.
an easy way of saying he just wants to be a booty call.
i couldn't hurt someone i cared about that way.
i don't know, i think it is mixed.
what if some guy would ask, why are all woman _num_?
you don't have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down!
so what should i do for her!!
i know i already said that.
he didn't care if he knew!!!
go on a cruise and push her overboard.
it what u make of it.
its not so good for the person who has the available booty.
mabey but ill never find him
she's playing with you is what my neighbor says is going on.
i ve never been with a guy who doesnt have a great body.
but definately force her because no bra is very unattractive.
you should call him and ask him
i have dated several bi females and its a turn on bigtime!!!
dont be so posesive, let him free, guys likes freedom
but i absolutely love italian women!
i'd give you _num_ for that one!!!!
keep your head high and dont give up hope if things dont work out!
if he speaks about it then listen to him and show that u care.
people are just plain dumb .
and i say this in the friendliest way that i can.
think of the &$%# he would get if he was dating a girl in jr. high.
your wrong on that one personal issues huh?
my advise: dont go out with a stranger.
chances are only once in a blue moon!!!
you shouldn't second guess what you guys do if both of you are cool with it.
no, this is not bad at all.
but if ur ok w/ it, and it should b ok!
if he is doing it by choice that should be questioned and watched very closely
guys r not scared of the word love.
thay left us know choice but to part.i never stop loving him.
go where ur p leads u mayb even in the wrong direction!
having sex with a guy who was toooooo smallllll!!!
why did you like doing it?
i went to clubs and that was just for a fun night.
i've heard of friends that start going out and find out they were eant to be.
none of the above,ask me about big boys or small boys,and i will tell you.lol
i love having phone sex w/my bf.
you really need to learn to read a person, you know?
or that he would like to see you wear, and then go back and buy it.
before too long..>>>>> you sucked them into your blackhole of lovin!
hay just be friends with him
(and i hope things turn out right..)
men dont like women to tell them what they need to do.
but dont feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down,life is long.
in my sweetie's eyes, i am.
because u already know so much about oneanother.
thats funny u asked that cuz i kinda felt like that about a girl once, cant really explain why.
or just pretend he isnt there.
if you're considering taking him back don't.
you're a threat alright, you just don't know it yet.
just speak with your eyes baby!
great kisser but great sex is nice too:)
yeah your just confused and don't know who you want right now
it depends on u. but would u want to?
oh, and if the guy is to marry the girl, she can't have slept with too many other guys.
it has to be something in the water!!
what kind of friend are you looking for?
nope.. maybe he wants _num_ hear ur voice _num_ he tucks himself _num_ bed.
probably the one thing that comes before good health on the human scale of existance!
you do understand they're just using you, don't you?
just latch on to his di ck and you will instantly own him.
sex is serious and dirty, making love is fun.
ha ha that stuff is all true thats how i get sometimes...
because some guys tottally lose their brain when they are around hot grl like me :)
when women get togeather thats one of the main toppics.
maybe you are into the bad boys???
you most likely can do alot better.
just where ever you go give her the best of the best!
i know i personally would want my daughter to be a lesbian because i know what guys are like.
if they dont then they arent worth you caring what they think
well now im pregnant with his kid... how do i tell him without him going balistic!!!???!!!???!!!
start by kissing, then start to do a little more.
it depends on the girl i guess, but i lie all the time and people really buy it :)
i wouldn't worry about the embarrasment factor there.
put your nose into her p...!
i know a women who was married to a jerk and he beat their kids.
find a new man if you care that much
if he gets the point, then stick it out...
keep that, you may find he is a really cool guy and want to stay friends
i dont know who you meet.
would you like it if your future husband cheated on you?
your charming smile baby, which costs nothing
if not someone will find u
well you can apologize,, but you can't have him back,, just accept what you already decided...
well in ur case im like ur g/f n ur like my husband !
because they are to in love and they think that theres hope
do not know, except that i am not on the list.
you know your man, if you trust him don't worry.
i can't think of any reasons.
there's hot and awesome guys that weigh over _num_!
should i go back or stay home?
better question... why is he your boyfriend?
i dunno..i just know that i just gained _num_
otherwise its just something else that may lead to love you never know
i go out of my way for a married man.
now im at _num_ and single.
you marry becasue you want to spend the rest of your life with the man!
maybe, _num_ she does and _num_ she doesnt.
how cool and we should thank him each day for wonderful feelings of sex!
depends if you believe in books about what dreams mean i guess...
let me guess: move to new zealand?
to each their own but i'll still be eating my chocolates and enjoying my roses while you...........?
my friend old me this when i first saw that word
bear in mind, that this guy hadn't been in a relationship for almost _num_ years!
i can't believe i wasted years of my life being with trash like you!!
as long as she isn't thier boss.
yep, some are way out there.hello.
yes, so that i can do the same to her!
if someone doen't ask you out, does that mean that you are unattractive or something????
_num_ marriage is not a joke!
he obviouly doesnt accept u for u so how can u stay with him no piont in being miserable.
dance for him with something sexy!
i wanna do things to you i wouldn't even do to an oreo.
i'm _num_ :-) would anybody lie about that age ?
never hide........... u might just loose them.
wow, sounds great except for the _num_ months thing, give it some time dude!
if ya want to make love for more than _num_ min at a time.. don't have kids..
if he did, he wouldn't cheat.
she's still probably living w/ her parents
y do it matter to u?
_num_ of all you can't help what you dream about, and _num_ fantasizing is just that, a fantasy.
and it makes ppl more anxious and jealous, so beware of that too.
hahahaha yeaah right like i am going to post that kind of personal info
i guess you are queer, just be your self, you can't please an human being.
if u dont doubt him anymore.. ur instincts r always d best sign
wait so he doesnt have a reason to hate you
what was that about now i am curious too.
have you ever had a fallout like that?
if this boy like you you should go with him.
tell your friend to tell him that you like him.
it ain't over till the fat lady sings!
hell no, u must be smart
you get even by becoming a better person then you were before you met her.
don't just go to him and say hey i wanna bone your sister really bad.
try being the women then i am sure ull find one.
i've been with my husband since i was _num_ and i'm going to be _num_ next month.
hang out with him a couple times and see what he is like
falling in love (really in love) is just magical... until reality hits you in the head :-)
i am to busy to respond to that.. #_num_ would be....
probably so couldn't stay away from eachother long!
why dont you call her.send some valentines card!
ask him where does he see his life going?
it is all about that dollar!
and really get to know her.
i started likin _num_ i didnt before when they asked me out so just ask.
i think she likes me because of the flirting, and person talk that goes on, between us.
i don't want to be annoying!
but remember that dating doesnt have to mean being boyfriend girlfriend.
not all guys it depends on the guy.
sense of humor is very important
repeat after me....you are a lying dirt face!
do not do it in private.
if you love a boy then tell hem
common, you want your cousin to love you.
once you have moved on then you wont care if he moves on or not.
because pain is pleaser, & when one bleeds it's like an orgasm!
:) seriously though, the best way is just to tell them.
may god and your fellow soldiers preserve you
then you kno wat to do......forgive.
once a cheater always a cheater!
say back off bitch i hate u
i only care who she is now.
realize mom and dad are happy being apart.
no but he see u more bitful at night cuz ur father is sleeping lol
sometimes it really sucks, but it'll be when its meant to be.
are u wanting to get married?
i've had this problem so many times just stick with both of them but just play your cards rigtht!!!!
if he wants to be friends thenso be it.
it's like your happy most of the time and you're always glowing.
marriage is better, no one said that it was going to be easy.
the gay guys love listening to them.
kiss her on the cheek first and if she knows what u mean shell carry on from there.. ;)
if she blows you off, forget it.
if you love someone then you sacrifice being with other people.
u cant put ur life to be all about her.
think, what's her favorite resturaunt...cofee shop...vineard...etc.
now you get two of everything.
but i would not agree that girls should attack first!
maybe a hot bath for both of you!
so my suggestion to you is dont get serious about getting serious
it probably wasn't the brightest thing for him to tell you, but i wouldn't worry about it.
if you truly in love you dont want anything else.
if my hubby cheated, i'd probably chop his thing off and hang it from the mustang's rearview mirror...
your a guy love is a very wierd thing.
dont compromise your salvation for anyone.
i have too much to live for.
open it and ask her just like ya did here.
tell him that you love him&#_num_;her in any way.
make it look like u want her like something else.
my bf notices so many girls when hes driving and he tries not to make it obvious.
treat him just like you would a good friend you have not seen in a long time.
would have sex with more than one guy at once?
sometimes guys say that stuff to play you.
if i really think about it i want to be with both of them i guess.
dream of me for _num_ years, then hop on my boat
to you what can a woman do say or look like in order to be sexy
crushing on a guy, and knowing he likes me too?
i loved this guy but after he humiliated me in front of _num_ ppl, i dunno wat i feel!!
no,just leave him like a dog and he'll know how good you are!!
of course, if it feels right.
have i told... you lately... that i lub you...?
i dunno how il get over him.
i prefer a friend to whom i can talk!
we have had lots of in & outs.
if you dont mind being her backup then okay.
u dont take any precaution and u get pragnent
maybe u just need mr.just for me
is it too far for u?
when you're both naked and in bed together
if you really like him you will just know.
you can stop trying to control her life?
my guy does he says that it gives him an oppunity to tell be how beautiful i am
(think about what that makes you look like to his friends?
well, i would date a girl who was stripper, because i don't matter who she was.
no, he should not get married to her at this time.
but your bf isn't you bf.
i luv not having _num_ worry about n e body but myself.
what is wrong with you ?
oh, and if guys knew u said that nobody would like u, just so u know.
of course.. just tell him everything you know
(careful if hes a non-understanding homosapien)
... oh yeah, a great sense of humor, good-natured and self-confidence.
i would not like to be the _num_ guy if she thinks about the _num_
he's such a sweet heart but i tell ya, i've gotta question his thinking skills sometimes..lol.
pick me but be a little more specific on type or stereo i mean age counts too!
why does she want to look?
i dont like to hurt anyone.
kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her!
my boyfriend of alittle over a year now has continued to lie to me throughout our relationship.
did he do it on purpose???
at least you can trust us cause even if we lie you'd know!
ask her why she in the relationship and how she feel about you
becuase they usually just like to make you feel bad.
but to answer your question no there is no way to understand men.
i love my bf/childs father to death!
obviously you decided you don't want to sleep with him or you would have already.
y cant they just treat us with respect?
which of course really pissed my off.
your suppossed to sign that thing????
god doesn't care about sexual procliviites, what a narrow way of thinking!
a nice yard wedding worked for me.
people freaked out about that, but i'm glad i married him.
only if your heart desires to, if your gut says run then do so
once a cheat, always a cheat...
wait and see what she has to say.
maybe he thinks its your fault that u have a baby.
no offense to any good men out there
however i really do love her.
but i am unsure of that.
and do not encourage your girlfriend to become a stirpper.
my bffl went ut w/ a really short guy and they even kissed.
if he says sure hye's not cheating.
she likes u like a bother
if i do then why would i be snooping around in his stuff?
maybe its because he is not lonely.
no, that makes u the girl of my dreams!!!
kick his ass and get rid of him.
i here a coat hanger and a vacuum will do the job
he doesn't love you, break up with him and don't even listen to his excuses!
you see her looks and thats it!
if u dont u'll never have contact with him.
being good all the time is boring.
we have hormones too, you know!
no, unless you feel you need to doubt that.
sweet heart i love you so much.
got anything better to do the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
right then is when you need to relax for a while.
sometimes i come back to my hometown to get away which is across country to where he is.
have sex right before you go to bed
try yes if u like him and no if u dont!
but if i had to choose...black... white men just don't do it for me..
and depends on if he likes war games or sports or role playing ect...
i don't want him as a boyfriend anymore.
i guess becuase they are loved, if not they wouldn't find it.
the coaches were more laid back and i usually played over half the game.
they just think differantly than you.
it can even help your relationship
just keep going till you hit the next level i.e level _num_
i speak idiot, gruntinees and jabberwocky..maybe i can help pm me
mayhaps you should travel to the uk and find this out.
okay, most of the girls in your campus hate him.
like ours go to their breasts.
dump the one you have (trust me: she'd be shocked!
open your mouth and say something!
give her something really nice and then ask right there on the spot.
who the fuck can i answer if i don't even know if u are a boy or girl.
love is not rare dont worry and dont be the bit*ch ok?
she should decide to prevent getting pregnant.
if he's cheating then kick him to the curb.
start from the day of your wedding.
of course i have plenty of friends who are guys......yet i have plenty of friends that are girls.
ur future is not bright it;ll leads u to death.
but if ur worried about it cuz there's no commitment u guys should talk first.
i hate wearing flats and i won't do it just to make a guy feel better.
if he loves you, he will be heartbroken, but he will get over it.
y do u marry him when he's quiet and noe u want him to talk to u?
i see it online everywhere.. i was just wondering
so if you havent slept together yet...don't.
what kind of father does that make him???
go hang around with some really rough men, you know, a ' man's man'
the problem is, i dont know if she likes me.
i don't like a big cry baby though!
it means that she likes you as a brother
that only works in bad teen movies!
perhaps... but obviously not enough feeling for her to leave his wife.
if not, stay with your sister!
alright, the way it's always worked for me is to go out with a friend.
do he still like me r is he playing games
i don't like the way they cus.
the problem is, how can i say no and still remain good friends?
some are 'snugglers', some are not.
i invited her over and we went inside my room and i shut the door lol.
i think so for romantic love plus its really fun
did u watch movie the game?
just don't tell her you love her too early.
i want work to be over with today and forever!
remember the good times and forget the bad but it takes time
i saw them last year they were great etc
she's not even in college yet, and u want _num_ have a serious relationship?
if u cant do that then maybe u can email him.
the more you think about here the more you want here.
at times i think only sex.
it should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you.... go for it!!
noooooooooooooooooooooooo but it can make it alot worse!!
maybe d love wasnt really that much when u got married.. u just thought it was!
b/c then when one hurts u, o well u hav another to fall bac on.
tell her to try asking him out or something.
lovin up with some skeezer tramp.
....if she doesn't like you enough to remain only with you, it's not worth it.
you should go out with a guy you like.
she cant stop you from seeing your little man.
a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
i would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you!
you daughter is acting stupid and you should tell her so, then shut up.
maybe the same way you told us!
if i didnt have kids i would die for the one i love.
why so many men dream about living with an asian girl.
please help: what do i do??
cheat on her with one of her friends and treat her friend better than u treated her
tell her not to see any bad guys!!!
wow, alot of my friends' girlfriends ask me this same question.
still trying to figure that one out myself
well try kissing him...are there any sparks?
yeah my boyriend is crazy abou my toes!
do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
make it slow and steady... opss i'm a man...
are you hearing your self out?
tell him what you want, basicly, and lead him,
can't he get a girl to share hers with him?
you get bored easily when with him/her.
you know what you should do.
sorry but my magic _num_ ball says no
well one day i sat him down and told him i liked him.
she asked me about my feelings...
well all depends on how long you been with her .
because if u knew that, u might try to do or be that.
you just opened a can of worms!..lol.
if she wants to, she will when shes free.
there is no way that that's the problem.
the dress, and brides maids dresses might take you a month alone lol
later on that month things started changing.
i would say that is not okay because just because hes a guy doesnt mean that its right!!
i'd go wit jamookae ,hz gt serious emotional issues!
i was thinking about how to kiss her next time:)
this my opinion,that's whow i think about this!
yes there are, i am not one of them.
why should u kill that innocent baby
she's just not that into you.
be nice and relaxed and let her know that you like her.
then they might come after you or it was just not ment to be.
step _num_: if you don't see any result after _num_ weeks.
_num_ out of _num_ times, what you like seeing him in, isn't what he is comfortable in.
but i'm not the one who did anything wrong.i love him so much what should i do?
remember, just because a guy knows your involved, doesnt mean he wont try anyway.
roses are red, violets are blue.
!, and heelll nooo, it's not wrong, do what you gotta do
perhaps his wife doesn't seduce him the way she used to.
ya i care, but its not everything
he'll understand and think nothing of it.
you marry the one you can't live without.
yes find your next boyfreind .dam there are alot of lonly peoples out there move on
you have to basically overdose to get off.
if someone used sex toys and it wasn't good then it didn't help them.
sorry its always gona be aucword and kinda weiro ish.
so how do i get it to come out again?
if i knew who she was i could help.
not just honest but honorable........... ie not a cheater or player
i like school teachers...but i'm not one.
i wear glasses and i have had boyfriends.
if i had met the woman of my dreams she would be everything i need.
after i busted him cheating of course.
don't make yourself sound so disgusting....and cheap... married men are off limits...
i love to dream, about different men, i guess it's okay.
straight up tell them and at the right moment.not whn there is a bunch of ppl around
_num_ is pretty young to be gaining a lot of weight.
just stand firm and tell him it's over.
you are too young and too many things can go wrong.
he got what he wanted... he is done with you.
and if not the pet store... just look around the barns.
no, if you already free him in you're life and find another girl.
if i knew, i'd be in front of you!
i don't know you to love you!
it's too late, you missed your chance, and she has moved on now.
guaranteed there is someone who likes her that she's missing because she's obsessed with this other guy.
so you like a lesbian and your not a lesbian that makes no sense what so ever
just hit me up and we'll talk about this one.
instead of telling him -show him what you like...
most will if they get the chance but your not married so .............its about _num_ i think
someone watches him every move now!
tell her to get serious and figure out her lifegoals.
you say that but you cant make it happen.
it doesn't matter if he doesn't have much experience with women.
he will care so much more about you.
my wife kissed me then walked out with the kids.
if you want to be friends, email me at _num_@yahoo.com.
i don't know maybe i'm just a liar.
that what i decided about matt.
go to the beach or someplace to eat.
it dont mean that he dont love you.
sound like hes trying hard to act uninterested and you aren't doing the same.
i'm into the doggystyle position, yeah!!
hell, last saturday, i had to pretend to be a shemale like _num_ times!
you have to do something to get him to notice you, it's worth a try!
shit, knock him upside the head!
if you are always asking for money, you need to get yourself a job.
try talking to him first.
i didn’t really think much of it
whenever i come around, its the same old problems over and over
by her excepting you-she already knows you’re a newbie
you really should break up with him
we’re friends after i asked her to dance
i think you should call her and tell her how you feel.
it's good that you're dooing new stuff.
they told the truth.
use it or loose it.
be on time or someone else will take it.
yup it is but ru in luv?
he tells me they mean nothing to him
find someone else to tell him _num_ u
i think he was friends with them once
your sister can help you out
depends on if you're a guy or girl
are you saying im a crappy person?
girls everywhere on earth
past is the past man, let it go and have some fun!!!
if you really liked her nothin else would matter
she's fooling herself if she thinks he was ever hers to miss at all
you are one in a million.
you can't see them, but you can feel them.
you don't have to worry about that.
it's so exciting, feeling this way about someone!
i'm a man, so it has to be about sex.
why does it seem like men are stronger, tougher, more honest and hardworking than women?
i could not stop laughing!
dump that chic while you still can, she's just using you!
good luck, your gunna need it!
don't you ask, bug him til he asks you out
check out these pix of young dudes
he wants a break. you boring him or hes doing someone else
don't get down to that level, youre better than that
me and my fiance both do that
if you show her love and trust, she will love ya even more.
neighbors complain about the noise i make, jeesh.
he won't hang on to a wife for long!
i have the same idea about wrestling.
when you feel it, you'll know what it is.
yeah, it was the french that was used by everyone, and that works all around.
if you know what the answer is, please share it with me.
if he does things that worry you, you should not date him.
follow what your instincts say, they will guide you.
jealousy is really hard to deal with.
in my opinion, it would be interesting.
honey, you can trust me because i am a guy
ask your older sister again.
read this and tell her to stop.
my partner doesn't behave as such. he simply doesn't hesitate to begin and becomes immediately immersed.
that avatar has almost the same questions as mine!
i am thinking too much about all these other girls he talks to.
ibelieve being in a relationship is wonderful.
just kiss him out of the blue one day.
i intensely want to resume our relationship.
at least he would like for you to be involved.
seducing women feels like an achievement.
teeeell him to go away.
purchase a bouquet of roses for her for valentine's day and invite her on a date.
you're not genuinely required to request her romantic partnership.
if you think he's so cute and you like him, ask him out!!
i'm pretty sure she's not a virgin if it's during sex!
if you wanna hit me up at _num_@hotmail.com we can chat about this later
there's no free lunch or fireworks :(
i like getting advice
you have to be normal.
it's difficult ambulating to converse with a woman.
do not ask via text as that is just lame.
planning is good, but don't plan excessively.
she is very loyal to you
i havent done this for someone else before, how do you do it?
i can't understand why a guy can't talk to another girl without his gf thinking he is cheating???? like wtf?
wow, i talked to that guy for _num_ hours!!!
it's great that you are so aware of the environment.
awww, you like yourself, that's cute.
always stand up for yourself, no matter what!
the duplicate reason that the majority of women are simpleminded.
your life will be over if you try that.
i very much want to but i do not want to do it meaninglessly.
if each week there is a different one, then i doubt it. you should, however, check the signs, especially eye contact and flirting.
why be so worried sweetie, love conquers all in the end!
trust me, i consider myself a relationship doctor.
if i am interested in a man, then i ask him on a date before another woman does.
however, that takes some time to develop.
bill gates was probably undesirable, but look at him now!
god is happy with love, even w/o sex
woman in the street but freak in the bed
i have no certainty, prepare his dinner meal, demonstrate your empathy.
he or one of your friends who knows him might know. ask one of them.
she does not want you.
it is all in how you use it man, it is never the size.
no, i do not care about that of my boyfriend.
see how he deals with you going out with one of his buddies.
you have a lot of work ahead of you.
what fun things can we do together after school?
talk to her and tell her that seriously that she's too old to act like a child.
we lie easier than men do.
they don't like you
ask if he still like you
if you keep trying to force it you'll just end up alone
you aint no virgin, don't be actin like you somthin better
just go and introduce yourself
i'll do anything once, twice if i like it!
do not do anything.
he is more mature because he is three to five years older.?
would you really wanna be with that kinda person for the rest of your days?
the way i see it, if your gut says something's going on, then something is.
don't act stupd and not listen to advice, you should shoot for a typical level of smarts
these days, most everybody's had sex before!
what it boils down to is me figuring out who i wanna get married to,
doesn't matter which one, just depends on how we feel and the day.
he lies and hangs up on me.
if you hesitate, you'll never do it.
is he killing his chances?
no, but who is every happy?
are you happy when somebody asks you out?
i get reminded of him and what we had by just about everything.
i think he'll go to jail here although you said it was a mutual thing.
it takes me only a month to fall in love.
how can you two be in love if you can't trust him?
why does my former boyfriend continue attempting to arouse jealousy?
what is the worst thing that they could say?
have one of your family members take pictures and recording if you rent.
she may act like that again, but thank you i will be sure to tell him.
i do not get overly concerned about it.
are you and your partner still together?
pretend to like it, even though you may not.
find some barry white songs, they work for setting the mood.
you do not have to have a relationship.
i am a twenty year-old woman.
however, an excess of positive circumstances may transform into a hindrance.
and you merely want to be genuine.
it is okay to be emotional while talking to her.
it is about the one with whom you are.
how about u first become friends with a woman
"ughhh" would be my response if i got that same lame ass kiss today
well.. don't wanna show off but ma girl is my everything, my purrrfect love
damn, it's difficult to find friends
been there done that... my ex did the same
i think a bit of both.
just be yourself see what happens.
when you’ve had enough you’ll say you can’t hurt me anymore.
you’d look great if you got a boob reduction.
you ain’t getting none tonight buddy!!
my girlfriend is better then the nudies i get
don't run away, he just tryna talk
kill him if he cheats on u
leave him alone because he's giving you horrible advice and isn't the one.
my choice was corect becase i still see him now and then.
he's _num_ year old and still hasn't wet his wick.
it depens on if you still care _num_ her.
u shouldn't be doin it in the first place
don't worry what others think. its okay for you to like him
he slept with his best friends wife
i need someone to put me back together
unless its your best friend suggesting it, i would have to say no way.
you are not going to get anywhere with them so just leave them.
i always see others the way i want to see them not how they really are.
i didn't want to be lonely, so i did it.
i am sure that they feel the same way about women, lol.
some girls do and some don't ??? everyone is different.
if he skirts the question or gets mad, red flags should go up!
when a man really loves you, he dont' try to push you into havin a abortion.
did he say he doesn't luv you or just that he's not right for u?
gettin cozy wit u would be nice.
why do men lie lots?
if she wants to confuse you, i suppose it is time to leave her for someone new.
mind your personal hygiene.
try searching somewhere other than where degenerates spend time.
do not do something which you will later regret.
if i married the lady of my dreams, that would be everything that i have dreamed of.
i've gone to some before
i've hung wit big guys before
most men ain't stupid
come on ladies, if a girl like you, u should know.
you sure that's what you want?
well, it's not meant to be if he tries to say goodbye
have you seriously not seen the paris hilton video yet???
i reallllly need someone to love!!!
you guys need to be able to ajust and try to be understanding!
a real harry chest i don't understand, a little bit i do.
he make you happy, tell your family.
if she happy with her looks, support her.
no i didn't, i waited to be asked out by him.
that dude got hitched.
tell them you love them and see if they return the feeling.
you've got every right to be angry.
do you want to be with someone who doesn't know his own heart?
my friends mock him all the time.
you are among the worst people in the world.
but, the difficult part is making this person stay with us.
go ahead and send a text message.
not being a virgin is a sin in the eyes of the lord.
all right, his age is between _num_ and _num_, and your age is what?
ur hot mature and happy
sucks when men do that
will not be w/all hair.
find someone whowants to share future w/u
he love you single
he thinks its good
things that make me no longer aroused are body odor, passing gas, and constant belching.
i still think about him.
you can ask him out, and see how he responds.
it was a different time, with different ladies.
trust me when i say that you cannot change them.
you do not need him or anyone else to degrade you.
he loves me more, because i was a virgin on our wedding night.
if you are really in love, buy a plane ticket and go get married to them.
i enjoy watching a woman masturbate and will have sex with her as soon as she finishes.
u sshould let her know your true feelings.
women can be friends, but not men?
simply behave as an unruffled man, refrain from treating girls presumptuously.
there is strength in ya.
she will leave this fling and move on.
how long have you been married since that happened?
if you ask and he doesn't like your kids, leave him since family comes first.
that’s a whole other story!
so i just tell my hubby to get out?
i’ve heard that guys actually prefer virgins.
is that a problem?
i'm sorry but i can't tell you anything since i don't live there.
you're sinning if you're hanging out with unsaved people.
i say go to the movies or go look at the sights, or stuff like that.
when we meet we share similar feelings.
tell her that you have been wanting to tell her something.
you'd want it more than one time.
he did it once, so he will do it again.
break up wit her.
i care for him and i need him!
what's wrong with chillin?
homosexuals like me - dunno why
groovy! my bff hearts me
she go ham but maybe she illin'
they just wanna be loved
i want her to like me...
our family hated they had an interracial relationship... my dad and great gma especially!
i'm tryin to say beauty is only on the surface
a lot of people think blue is the color representing love because red makes them think of blood.
can you honestly say you want him back?
you didn't wipe even though you used the bathroom there?
you should kick him to the curb and see how you do on your own.
from now on during sex will the tv be on because that was bad!!!
youre gonna be a awesome sister.
one day he started hitting on me.
since you like that one man, other guys are gonna be jealous.
don't make a issue out of something thats so natural.
i repeat, this is something that you want to tell him face to face.
the headboard thing ruined the mood, and i did not get to come.
i luv my wife very much.
if they agree to the request, you should ask him to spend time with you.
am _num_ have waited till marriage for sex
do they think he just isnt sure of himself or what?
he is barebackin it
think she knows u like her without telling her that?
i'm already fallin just cant
chicks love dudes that aren't like everyone else.
if they love you they'll always be there for you, no matter what.
yes, just do them together then.
the answer is simple, don't do it!
did you try to hard?
men work till the sun goes down, but a woman's job is never done.
that sounds just like flirting.
the girl you are into will be by herself and she hates that.
i like him but can't say i'm in love with him.
if you do it right it won't matter.
if you never try anything with her you'll never know if it works
he'll never know what you want unless you tell him
so you're starting to hate your lovers friends
do you have any idea what i had to do to get over this.
love isn't all bad, you should give it a shot.
some creepy guy followed me in the store, he was super scary!
do not be selfish, give pleasure during sex not just get it.
tell her that if she wanted you she would come fuck like monkeys and she would suck and swallow.
its normal to think but not act on it like killing yourself.
knowing you are the shit is the key says my dudes.
he would care about the small crap if he really cared about you.
i think about him _num_
you can see the ideas from knot.
you have a hubby, so what are you complaining about?
he will propose to you.
i want a man who is true to hisself.
do whatever you want.
the ones that pop up unexpectantly are the ones that are really from the hart!
if my woman died, i would kill myself, i couldn't live with out her.
if he doesn't do what you want, no sex for him
he doesn't want you to do that
tell him you don't wanna fuck
you need to worry when he starts seeing somebody else.
i don’t get this thing they call love.
i’m humbling myself by telling you i have all the qualities you talked about.
i won’t and a friendship just because we don’t agree.
i talk a lot in the yahoo chat room.
get used to crappy guys, who just want to use you.
have sex with math geek, they know how to handle those curves, ha, ha.
that's not my thing.
one day you'll wake up and just know.
i'm married, trust me, i know.
don’t be so careless or you’ll end up pregnant.
hes trying to control you, get rid of him!!!
i really like bad boys, how bout you?
if they really love you, they’ll except your flaws.
love is the same for everyone.
that is not very fair to the man with whom you are currently in a relationship.
i despise that type. remember that money can purchase many things but class, style and grace are not among them.
it depends on the size of the male gentialia.
i tried to converse with him, but he has yet to call me.
my man works out so he has a nice bottom.
no need to doubt him!
gotta raise yourself.. he doesn't have to feed you..
well if you wanna be with him, don't leave.
even if it feels awkward, just ask him. if he loves you it will be worth :)
i'm here in urine bangalore.
i'm always even happy when i wake up and go to work
you have to look into your own heart see if you have feelings for him.
take no for an answer if she's not willing.
if he really likes you you'll know it.
when you change your mind, you wont be talking to her.
my guy friends are like my bros. we're cool.
what happened in class?
ask her if she's into you.
thats messed up she did that in front of u
the bad guy seems to be my thing
pray to the great dude g--o---d and his baby the big j
take her out, maybe go shopping.
i promise that every female who believes she excessively obsesses over sexual activity has no actual understanding.
it will cost you three points for each answer.
i believe that it is a myth and that you are all intercouse addicts.
you should leave him alone because he got what he wanted and perhaps no longer wants to talk to you.
i really need imput from other people
you can't buy off your kid, you gotta put in the time
you want a good thing don't just stand around waiting
i need your help, the wife and i've been trying to get pregnant and can't
depends on my wife's mood right then
i've married two times. with the first one, i knew right away. my second marriage is still unravelling.
if you email me, i will tell you everything that i know.
you've admitted he is in love with someone else.
you should believe in yourself, which is really sexy.
because their thinking is not clear.
be patient until things chill
men won't cheat if its hot under the sheets
go slow you'll be able to tell by her body language
give her attention and chocolate lol
i do not like that word
if you love other people, they will love you in return.
where he asked you out is his decision, and you made a mistake.
you should tell him that a mutual respect for one another has to be established.
you will get out only what you put in.
have you ever comitted a felony?
the true reason you're a winner or not is finding love!
act liike a girl trying to find an nsa hookup and shoot him an im.
your partner gets hurt if you go out to have fun when you're with them.
i wanna get together with my ex-bf.
shit, that's gotta have been a super tough thing to feel.
some homies don't like anybody touching that ass
until you fall in love, it can be hard to understand
how fast into the first date.
not all guys only think about sex
that behavior may be for a reason
yuk, yuk who has a chicken butt? not me!
i'm a female, i can't have sex with a guy unless i have strong feelings for him.
who knows? if he has friends, it could mean he has the hots for you
i don't know, but if you find it please let me know!
he cheated on your cousin and i feel like he will probably cheat on you too
it's rude to not return the favor
if anyone knows him, let me know. i miss him.
what is a relationship if you can't talk to each other about that stuff?
i don't think its a sin, but it certainly leads to sex!
but if you do it, have fun.
from the sound of it, you are more interested in virginity than are most guys.
my boyfriend and i broke up after eight years. i really did love him.
it was an eye-opening experience for me.
what do u think about marriage????
is it possible to have custody if hes a stay @home dad
i think ya got a boyfriend.
hey try it, it could work for you.
they are not bffs anymore!
but we never got together, he stuck me in the "friend zone".
he even loves my baby
chill your cash flow
start with what you really dont want to do.
if you’re too shy to talk to her try doing things she likes to get her to notice you.
maybe she’s acting weird because she’s hiding something?
depends on how you feel, there's a bunch of different factors.
most men need to have sex all the time.
can you handle a serious relationship like that?
let her have one and see what she does in front of all those people
can you even read this stuff you wrote?
you've got mad skills, man.
the more you throw yourself at the fella, the more he'll open up to you
it's my choice, no one else's matter
let them go no matter how long takes to do so
u need some cash i got ya
should i dump her or keep hanging on hoping that she really does love me?
if you want to surprise her, just say it in the middle of the conversation .
i think that love takes a really long time to die.
i am intersted in him, however, i do not know that he is intersted in me.
i want it more than guys do.
try thinking about how they feel.
what in the world should i do then?
a woman wants many things from men.
want more _num_ listen send me an email
agree but dont think its bad
now she sees ur happy and sees wat she threw away
just one, the first and the last one.
because it's hard to get back to being friends once you've crossed out of the friend zone.
admiration is nice but not reason enough to be kissing.
it's way too long if it hurts the woman and she can't take it.
yeah dudes not gonna change toilet seat stayig up
yeah he's just tryin to get it being ok for him to cheat
keep an eye out he doesn't seem loyal at alll
shit man i ain't soft just on the level
she don't want to pull any other dudes that's what she doing
he didnt want a _num_ chance
he'll become jealous. inform him how you dislike that as well.
perhaps you become too attached after intercourse and it frightens men into leaving.
young lady, it is alright if you do not want to have sex with a man.
does it matter since you received yours?
it is hard to get rid of the memories.
my name is shaba, please send me a friend in amsterdam.
women like strong men.
you need to be careful.
some men are just different.
if they don't like u for who u are, u don't need 'em.
if they made you happy, you won't flirt with other females.
buy some flowers, and tellhim your in love w him.
do u still have feelins for them>
you need a side piece, keep your bf but find another person.
ur mother already kicked uncouth, none of her business anymore.
serious girls are serious about stuff like that.
guessing u already tried talking to him?
if he’s into just being friends, move on.
never let people tell you any differently.
if they’re nice then why be mean?
if hes still on you let im go
hug prob wasnt the best idea
havent met the one as of yet
dont cross me ive got wisdom on my side
why didn't they say?
a wolf & a lab
when i was in bora bora sent him a post card
u will meet someone who will make u forget bout him
hot women are at the librabry & walmart
heck yeah it's possible. it happens to me all the time.
also you're still waiting for him to put a ring on it.
she's testing you when she looks at you.
i owe you big-time for helping me plan this wedding.
just remember the more you give the more he takes.
try it sometime, you won't be disappointed.
you need to find a younger man to date.
no, i hope the girl that dumped me drops dead. i won't even give her a second thought anymore.
the egos are fighting.
it really depends on what's going on.
i think a woman should decide for herself.
clues from secret admirer are pointing to you.
if you dump a guy and he's not desperate, he won't hit you up again.
is there a chance you could be pregnant?
just ask him to hang sometime if you think he wants to
if she's wasted you gotta make her agree that you guys wont hang out
turns out that my lady was really a dude.
dont be agressive, just be nice and stuff
i saw you on a cd, famous singers are the best
existence possesses such a quality, individuals causing pain for one another.
they have to be relaxed and in the mood for love.
i would be honest with him, he will most likely not care.
for _num_-_num_ months we've been talking
hopefully u will find new besties soon!!
i saw that to when i went out there!!!
it's just because guys hormones are totally different from girls.
i like a girl with small breasts and a cute behind.
how am i going to be able to handle not being a jealous girlfriend.
if it has been a long time, then you should say 'no' in response.
they are weak minded, it is not your fault.
how much does the child's father participate?
why was he imprisoned?
say i don't need no more friends
apparently you have to have a big dick to be able to have a serious relationship
they have to acknowledge it
she is totally oblivious to the fact that she ruined my life!
get over it move on with your life
most guys can have females friends to right?
i'm sure it'll be alright with that
take a look at that.
pity does not cause me to have intercourse with you.
is it normal to have intercourse with one's boyfriend?
it does not have anything to do with you, though.
you should approach them first.
no one knows as in the end it is all up to you.
noo, not unless they specifically said that it is no longer cancelled.
she is not romantically interested in you—or, possibly, you approached her too aggressively.
i do not think there is anythign wrong with it.
you will know you are in love when you can not stop thinking about the person.
you're _num_, woman, go find someone your own age.
getting married turns people irresponsible and abusive.
i'd believe he's sleeping around
depends on the situation
if i'm a dude will you date me?
it’s not only for lovers.
would i put myself in dangr for others?!?
im just wondering whats happning here?
take it easy so he dont hafta hear he sucks at kissing.
don't matter what ya say its gonna hurt them no matter what.
lets know _num_ another better.
he likes me and hes _num_-_num_ years old!
it may be hard, but act like you're not interested.
so, make sure she is aware of how much you care about her.
what are the signs of a man flirting with you?
you ask her and see if she replies honestly.
flirt with them and say you love them.
time is of the essence, you should move on.
he screamed when he was looking for his razor.
it means that she probably would not have left you if you would have been more calm in the past.
break off relations with him. you're squandering your days by remaining in a relationship.
neither of us could think of a preferable alternative.
my sister has since broken up with him, but she is pregnant with his child.
find her something with meaning.
when shes not hitting you up anymore.
almost forgot, ladies, have you ever used sample makeup from the mall?
there's still hope for those chicks.
many men are not dumb so don't say that
yep, a large man is a no for me in a relationship.
jim is who i know him as
when she hardly ever sleeps with you
do not sleep with him, it will drive him wild!
why would he refuse to speak with me?
after that, i learned that he is interested in me.
i get hungry two times every day.
ask, she will probably like if you can help.
it would be in places where african american men are.
btw, there's talk that condoms aren't _num_ i'd rather have that than nothing at all.
check it out for me?
she may've been able to fool people before, but she wont be able this time.
it depends on how she feels about herself.
yet, only when they're horny or to spice it up.
best way to get back at him, move on and forget he was ever a part
loyalty, kindness, and sweetness are crucial
no matter what keep it that way even if she gets mad
it doesn't even matter how you use it sometimes
our aim is to make the ladies comfortable
also that his genitals are small.
how are you trying to fix the the trust, and what kind of girlfriend is she to you?
especially if you are used to regularly having intercourse.
due to them possessing singularly defined thinking.
you can tell him. unless he is gay, he would do that.
did i tell you lately that i think you're hot?
you can't ask dumb questions like this.
they have less mature brains than we do.
maybe not love but who knows?!?
he’s not on drugs!!
you never know when a man is going to act as a coward toward his responsibilities!!
it’s heaven and hell, just look around.
whatever you’re saying is soooo true.
i enjoyed reading what you got, but thanks for the info
have fun or keep active
only if you think you need a bf
men are like dogs in that, they're hunters, they wanna chase you... so run.
how do i figure out if my bf is in love w/me?
people certainly know you're single with that questions.
maybe i'm just timid or scared
you're going down a bad road be careful!
it keeps you from having fun with other people
yes, i like the bad boy type!!
get out there and have some fun while you can.
u will know fast enough if you take off your clothes in front of him.
if u can help me out with by recommending me to some of them, i'd be thankful.
at least that way i would be into her.
the lady will wait if she truly loves the dude.
she does not answer me when i ask her to be my girlfriend.
it is only what is on the inside that matters.
do you suppose that married women perform fellatio?
it has to be your choice.
get with better men because i will expect her to do the same.
if you're unable to tolerate a friendship with him, then allow him his solitude.
if you work at it, it will continue to grow forever.
do whatever makes you happy
all the hot guys are fags.
i'm single but it's hard to get a gf. help?
dad's like that, too.
boys think i'm hot.
she felt me and my lover there.
she friends zoned you but she likes you!
i don't believe in love.
how grown up does the kid seem?
what does love even mean?
true unless i figured out i didnt want it
people want the perfect man but dont want to be a perfect person
only if shes double ur age
and the people most important _num_ u???
she gets shes got to go but shes having trouble any words of advice?
maybe hell ask u out.
their aint noway to get that info.
dating is gonna b hard _num_ u.
hes as dumb as me.
this is quite an egregious negative situation.
think about children after you ask him to marry you.
it depends upon whether you are also a young woman or not.
here's my advice. trust her.
unless you like being treated like crap move on
it is not boring but fulfilling.
i am a handsome twenty-eight year old.
nobody comprehends what true problems are until you get married and have children.
why do the women there possess facial hair?
no, they cannot because somewhere deep down under there is an attraction to each other.
he enjoys flirting, and he is an attractive man.
who or what can i turn to for help?
he will find a girl who loves and cares about him.
he will not help if he says no.
dont worry, things will improve, i swear to god
you're no adult, you should talk to your mom about that stuff.
dont screw with his emotions, just hush up
only if they are as into the situatoin as much as you are
my gf loves it in the ass.
maybe you married a dud.
second, if a dude is a cheater, you are hanging out with the wrong kind of dudes.
dude: i'm a caveman girl:what's this?
you should do it if you really love him
imo what sixteen said.
don't make plans please on valentines not matter how good it sounds.
doesnt matter how smart they are can still be dumb when it counts!!!
they'll get it sonner or later
relax... just do it... that's really not the best point in ur life
you really believe they won't cheat...
you can cry if you wanna, but you should use your words instead
it seems like they love you and wantchu back
i also am partial towards children, but i am not one.
you're creating the problems with him.
i do not think its a good idea unless you have a perfect partner.
yu can only rely on faith that what the other person says is truth.
inform him of your feelings for him.
if a male/female is unable to be forthcoming, proceed to erase him/her from memory!
however, on occasion, he behaves as if he continues to do so.
did you cheat on her?
comment on her hair, outfit, or shoes if you are fairly attractive.
i move on if a man does that to me.
it depends. not all men are the same.
bingo! you just figured it out for yerself.
step back and take a good close look, you'll know if he's up to no good.
show your appreciation so they know you care and weren't just using them.
there's a _num_ month waitin list for gettin into a poor house.
its not worth it if they aint right for you.
maybe because you're doing something wrong.
get rid of all his stuff.
its important if you're going to be single without a family.
females usually love jewelry if you have the money to spend!
just ask, all she could say is no, but, you will never know unless you do.
you will get asked out.
no, i think you are unable to spell adequately.
you need to prove she has been unfaithful and get divorced.
it's fantastic that you're attracted to this woman.
you don't know what will happen, which is why they call it love.
because, as you know, i attend the same school as you.
you may not find her attractive; but, she is happy with herself.
if you don't wanna spew it in his face, scream it out in front of your mirror when no one is there
you slept with him already?
they dont use they brain like they shud!
we gettin closer every day.....
men never seem to get women,,,its just the way f the world
i think that your feeling for him is only lust.
it did not work after i tried it.
it won't be illegal. that would be holding an individual for ransom, instead of dating her.
if she is right for you or not, her response will tell you everything!
i think it good to try it before you buy it
it happened without you even knowing it
if my sister's friend it a bitch, i would dip out.
you shouldnt buy a woman lingerie unless she says she wants it
how do i show that i love her so much
smile before you look away so the woman does not think you find her unattractive.
if he only likes her a little bit, then he should not get very upset.
are you sure that she truly has feelings for you?
the choice is yours if you don't want to have sex don't
i'd watch her if were you, doesn't seem like much of a friend
it could be because you're special
find someone on the same level as you.
i'm dealing with the same thing right now i can definitely feel ya
they do not appeal to me at all.
what can i do when i see her being so upset?
take some time to reflect on yourself.
however, currently he once more pays me no mind.
get you’re friends together and go out for a good time!
think about what would happen if you're married one day.
try practice a low speaking voice and confidence while at the gym.
find a card to show how you feel.
men are super competitive!
a lot of thoughts com during the night while you are sleeping.
additionally, inform him you had an unpleasant experience with another man who tried some things which made you upset.
god makes many different moves.
do not have intercourse with him and wait for his response. i hope this advice was helpful.
look into his eyes and you will know
you are my number _num_, don't question it
he needs to get out in the world
i like this girl and she doesn't know it. what should i get her?
i like hispanic guys better.
when things are bad, do you still really want each other?
if he is rich you better put up with him!
you can tell how worried you are cause of your spellings.
it does not matter what anyone else thinks, just that you two love each other.
what is gwen stefani's husband's name?
call and get it over with.
that is they type of loving relationship people want but never work hard to get.
people don't just randomly do things unless there's something in it for them.
who cares how big she is, she's still really hot.
my friend is going nuts over a dude that doesn't even like her.
hit me up on shrunkenmann_the grass@yahoo.com if your a girl.
they are not bad
thats disgusting.. don't know how you feel tho.
im bummed customer care removed it from the answers.
what do guys think? cute or sexy?
there's no doubt in my mind that im right
i like nice women
it's totally normal an health but be sure to rubber up to be safe.
men refused something when women are the ones wanting it
i perfer guy that don't screw around with chicks all the time
do yr best to some good electrics out of it
be honest w/ him about yor concerns
i ruined the friendship between jon and matt.
you could attempt to create a realtionship between him and a friend.
always obey your instincts.
it's possible that his girlfriend's homeliness drives him to seek satisfaction elsewhere.
don't be something you're not!
be smarter then that. don't believe that bull.
if he's going to treat you like that you need to move on.
does anyone here speak english?
post an ad in the paper
you cant keep it up if shes pregnant
men be like that
that bull you just have issues with asian chicks
it makes the phone yuck
walk that weight right off!
so quitting the team was the right thing for me.
tell him to fuck off
why is he in the doghouse
idk the answer.. why r u askin me?
i know it's not easy but it's better for u
well she'd leave you if she didn't love, right??
my love for her is true
hate to tell you, it'll be worse after you married.
im an old fashioned guy
depends on your relationship
pop in say hey anytime
don’t lose a friend over it.
it’s because your only giving _num_ effort.
we think we’re hitting on them, but they just don’t get it.
if it doesn’t wok out just start all over again.
i like chicks who are loud and crazy.
i'm gonna find new friends in amsterdam
is she hotter than me?
if your surfing the web... then yahoo answers-duh.
i know from experienc
emotions and feelings are what count.
how old are you?
i'm aware that this is easier said than done.
looks are not as important compared to how someone treats you.
send him away if he gets too possessive.
your back won’t hurt so much if you get a boob reduction.
first guy is right, make some more money and just be yourself!
i’m _num_ and just got a gf.
that's just how life it.
i'd wait until she is ready for a bra
you want to know if he still thinks your pretty.
he will love you more and be surprised by it.
why not just ask him the question in an email
just tell her you love her then give her some space.
lol. i was about to ask you the same thing!!
i gotta find something cheap but unique.
yeah, you can see some health benefits if you abstain from sex.
it’s never goi g to happen if your a teen or something.
what are you doing?
they are not the kind men that you want in your life.
if you are attracted to a man, then converse with him and begin a relationship.
i once heard that that was not true.
the reason that your are so jealous watching other couples is that you cannot get your own guy!
perhaps that's simply his identity.
do not tell him first. tell your mom, or the social worker for your school and allow them to tell your parents.
you are absolutely correct that you did the right thing.
kss the man in front of that woman.
well r they sick or good?
he says jump and you say how high
tell him that he needs to stop and let her be... he needs to get out there and find him a different one
she was a outcast rocker punk in a band with big blue eyes
if they get mad because you won't have sex, you need to move on fast.
a woman being taller than a man isn't bad, but it's funny.
if it's sacreligious, i'm out of answers.
your mom is seeing him
i like brunettes, brown eyes, flawless skin, and a cute ass.
good luck with that
don't ask how to get girls to dig you.
i usually don't worry about a guy's butt.
he seriously really likes you a lot.
i love my new lab puppy!
though it is really tough to avoid.
no, but when you are in love, intimacy will feel like a totally different experience.
imagination is the key because you only get what you can imagine.
i believe she simply wishes to come to america like all others, however that is just my opinion. take care.
that is a tough call so i would recommend that you date her friend to make her jealous.
how do i ask another woman to join is in the bedroom?
it’s cause your single w/o a date.
i think u should ask a dr or somebody u can trust.
should i tell my guy he’s driving me crazy when i’m with him.
get stuck in the rain, get soaked and tell ur guy to warm up by snuggling.
she either really likes u, but doesn’t want to admit it or she just wants to make it difficult.
see if he cares if u sent those pics
first and last time w/sex and tv watching
tell your husband he needs to step up to the plate!
i want to know if your lonely.
it means you're a big sis, we've got a new baby!
i will go cray cray on your ass if i see you with that ho!
you should play volleyball or b-ball if your really into sports.
no sex if you can't handle the kid
mo tough than strong
still ur friend, tho
just take her out on a date.
not all experienced men know what they are doing
ask her if she has ever been sexually intimate with a man.
by the way, tell your man why you don't like him.
me, i'm gonna say yes.
if you around _num_, then no, you to young.
i'm fond of one particular gentleman, jon, and in the past, he had fondness for me, as well.
one may be good at coitus and the other is good at listening.
men are beautiful regardless of their appearance or deeds.
and yes, i have many chances.
it seems as if he may have discovered an alternative method for providing himself bodily pleasure.
it's ok to be cheap.
she's a lady in the street but a freak in the sheets.
as a man, i know many men are in relationships for personal gain.
whhat's the reason you're not willing to let nonsense increase?
it really depends on whether she is unattractive, and how much so.
i do not think so. unless, however, you are trying to commit suicide?
i would sya no, unless you love it.
all she dreams about is him when she does.
if you smell, you should use soap.
that's how i envision it.
you could say, 'hello dear, would you like to have a soda?'
i don't have a shot at him because a different girl already likes my crush.
the information they gave was little vague....
i'm just mexican, nothing else.
cheer up. there are plenty of fish in the sea.
hard to live if she gone from life
she jus knows it isnt love
doesnt mattr if they m/f
it's your own choice to make.
you gotta move on, it might hurt but it's necessary.
who are you thinking about?
you gotta have fun while you still can and you're young.
you first impression creeped you out, so stop txting her.
yeah, that's what i'd do if i wanted to break up
i promise not to bring my friends
if some strange wacko were watching me i'd probably get worried
if you don't want to be with each other then it's obviously over
are u a schizo or something?
we make em nervous and they loose their brains
_num_ times a week we get it
if she gets herself off in front of me that gets me off
believe what u want
with someone that disrespects you like that why you even giving him the time of day?
men get all goofy when they're around women thy like
if you tired of guessin jus ask him if he want to git married
as long as you love each other who cares what it looks like
it will pay off eventually.
what are you talking about?
or maybe his male ego is so weak, he can't deal with a woman knowing about it.
he was a jerk, mentally and physically to me.
means he values u a lot
he isnt in love w/you
could they like each other?
most guys arent dumb just w/wrong people
wedding isn't just about you
we have sexual interactions over the telephone every day and never tire of it.
you should do something that most people have not.
prhaps she no longer boasts regarding him to her acquaintances, as before.
experience personalized entertainment at this point given your unattached status.
you should not have sexual relations with your cousin.
sometimes you must let men know your preferences.
the speed of the relationship depends on how long you have been talking.
here is not where you will find one.
young boys want to become men, and men want women.
trust your sense of humor, your beauty, your intelligence, you relationships and how you connect with others, and characteristics like that.
i would not want or need anything else.
there is an extremely attractive man in my neighborhood.
he either loves you or not.
shoot me an email if you find out.
like him? it's okay then.
you might have freaked her out.
guys and gals both have them.
get hitched at the court house.
so, whats your turn on?
for a good time -call me.
ur just a booty call
im outside ur window
first kiss made me dizzy
men... some do and some dont
u dont want to admit it but i think "no answer" is what you mean to say
men go straight for it, women want to take they time.
suck that dick once in awhile.
he might just be checking on you to see how you are.
if you ask him, we won't lie.
to make the house look and smell clean: get rid of the cat, steam the carpet, furniture, and bed linen, and, spray for insects.
if he cared about you, he would not have looked at the other girl.
end the relationship, he is not interested in you.
you must speak out against it.
is putting a ad in the local paper something we can do?
i am asking because it seems that men are always ready for sex.
it is a sexual story as well.
i apologize, but that is repulsive.
hey, brother, if you do not have a miami address, you're best served by traveling to this location. it is the most ideal.
if you like her, ask her out.
i don't, but home simpson is pretty hot!
tell him he makes a hot vampire!
astrology is a joke!
when you find your diamond, hopefully he feels the same about you.
i went to one with a belly dancer, but it was lame.
no one is able to decide how their dream acts.
it could that's why they have the name fantasies.
you might as well just ask him.
does he get into sex toys?
sex it up, like using food or cover yoself wit whip cream
good luck, you get em
don't let her mess wit your head.
say that your sad
some can and some can't live wit out it.
partner, friend or family any one
work it for it to work
seriously how old? im _num_
shes a player she wants a toy to play with
think older kids like mini golf, laser tag go karts
that doesnt work say u have a std
let her know you dont like it and if she dont listen, then run!!!!!
there are alot of phillippino chicks who meet men on line and then marry them.
how come you didn't ask him out, huh?
if being broken up makes them happy, then you should be happy too.
he will stare at other women when im not paying attention
we aren't together anymore
you know who he is because you've known him a long time.
you arent living in reality.
the next day i had dinner with my boo
do you like each other's children?
i would prefere chess cake
that'll let her know she matters vs. your buddies.
if love is what it's about and you're able to, it's most likely positive.
there's a bunch of different dudes,
how come she can't see since we all can?
we've flirted a bunch, but i still have no idea.
sit down with them and let them know you need understanding and support from them.
i get asked about sex alot.
cut him off now, so when y'all get married he will know the deal.
as long as you have a condom you can do it anytime.
you have to just be upfront and honest
i'd try working with him on it.
my sisters high school sweetheart is now married to me.
preggos = poor taste in clothes
do you have a good iron skillet?
you've got to make sure you ask him questions directly if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.
if i was just capable of being stupid i'd have gone on more dates.
he keeps saying that he respects and understands why i want to wait.
what the fuck should i say
dont be a cry baby
adapt to life because its like a roller coaster
if he isnt serious about liking you, forget about him
there is someone for everyone ive heard
ask me how i know he didn’t love you
you should watch pornography together
what options do a girl have?
go on with your life and get out of this relationship
don’t mess with a friend’s younger sister
if he loves u he wouldnt care hed be there
call the cops if hes not paying child support
is that even a ? for a man?
talk with her and ask her if she likes u
you might be bi if you are attracted to men, too.
she never go over you from the first time you all broke up.
how can i tell him that?
what am i supposed to do in this situashion?
it depends on the chick, if she likes your butt she will do it.
just trying to stop from fighting, she so easily gets jelly
its the best feeling youve ever felt in the universe
im just tring to convince her whats gonna happen before it comes
you can figure it out by the way they look and talk two you how they think yof you
starts out quiet then louder til all of a sudden.......... i max it out!
i’ve learned lots a new things.
you need to tell her that ya love her.
i had that one with your mom.
i can only answer _num_ question at a time.
i am pretty sure that that is what a guy would want.
you will get your answer depending on what she says.
its all good, plus i but some dough down on a food buziness there.
i want to spice things up, any ideas?
i make a different choice every so often.
go on many dates with different men in order to forget him.
you have two choices. get over him, or wait for him.
ponder it. my opinion is to terminate the relationship.
can talk if u want
ya if ur a dude
someone finally asked me but i thought that i would never be asked out on a date
if you are asking these questions you are too young to get married
when i was married i did not cheat on my wife
a woman will never admit to being wrong
who knows, they should be left alone
youll feel good if ya just laugh!
you gotta make sure you wanna communicate.
you can help yourself by helping each other and trying to get where he is coming from.
theyll realize the truth one day.
before you really screw up, go talk about it
it's best to break it to him gently, asap
ask him to go to dinner or a movie with ya
i had to get her drunk before i tried to kiss her
ask god what to do, ppl will come and go
you two been hanging around with your parents?
no, if they are only sick.
i don't want him to at all.
reflect on his personality, is he a nice, decent person?
be a friend. allow him some time to be alone.
allow your personality to show. do not pretend to be someone else, women can sense that.
it is easy to say yes, but i suspect it would be difficult to actually do.
refrain from initiating action because she'll receive her due at some future date and time.
i don't want to ask him if he still likes me because i still dig him a lot.
i believe that people want what they cannot have.
pass along the info and let me know if you need help.
do you really want our moms to lie?
not so sure if girls are bad liars.
did you guys have a conversation as to why he cheated
telling someone news over the phone or in person is definitely better.
things are not simple with kids at all
distance makes lies harder to tell
laying on the covers candles lit lights off
he broke up w/ me after a few dayz
love is caring for _num_ or something
_num_ bcuz ur a kid
that means u can have it all!
if he sayz no hes cheatin
go back to sucking your tiny dick
are you a dude or a chick?
totally i would since it's free
if your still into your ex, dont go for someone new
me and my husband moved in a couple of weeks ago, you should too
that is the same reason as mines
some men jsut need some extra stimulus to complete the task
follow it up, if you are into him
whatever goes on in a guy's head?
he know we don't know each other
if he don't admit it, don't allow it if you don't want it
men don't think wit they heads
women love men for their personality l!
you like a guy and he likes you two.
i know it’s a lot but trust me!!
make sure he’s helping with you’re bills too!
wait til he’s drunk then take off your clothes!!
have sex with the person you love.
nope, i wouldn't date a stripper!
don't care for big boobs.
then jon asked me if id be jealous if he hung out with that girl alyssa
so what do you like to do?
i can't pay attention to this and i expect other men can't either.
they'll love you if you can make em laugh.
they said "i can't leave my kids". the other said "then why did you ask me to get a cup of coffee?"
i'd guess between _num_-_num_ hundred.
don't be with someone who don't like you for yourself, there's plenty of other fish to enjoy while your young.
so what did you think was gonna happen??
give it a try. you might find out there's more than sex!
i married my man in _num_, july _num_ to be exact. then we had _num_ glorious weeks in hawaii
how do i get out of it
are u in love w him?
it's best if you just don't worry about it
when u are in love you'll know bc you'll never feel bored. that's true love!
why don't you have a job? if you did you'd have your own money...
are you making each other happy? then do what you're doin!!
well i enjoy good love songs and don't care that it''s sappy.
don't have sex with him and you won't come across as being cheep!
any advice on what to do when you're interested in a woman but not sure if she is into you??
are they interested?? then the chase is over!
that don't mean he don't care for you!
he could not have noticed that.
due to the majority behaving as oversexed morons unable to obtain it at all.
how old are you? also, i would like to be your friend.
the decision is entirely up to you but don't spend too much time looking.
don't push him to do something he isn't ready to do.
that shirt just shows too much.
the money is probably nice but there is a lot going on that people don't know about.
you better act fast or they may find someone else.
this can be a lesson.
do i stay or do i go?
first of all the age difference is bad so proceed with caution.
it made me laugh my ass off when i was reading it.
go to a party and talk to everyone.
because they think they're hot and wanted, they act that way in dating.
he needs to know that the worst thing he can say is no.
i want him to be kind and respect me, isn't that asking too much?
he is not worthy of your time or attention.
any thoughts on this, eh?
this guy my friends likes wants to get to know her bettter
we girls will never know the answer to that question.
i think you should since women feel mature for their age.
are you in love with someone?
i stopped a child who was running across the street in the rain from jay walking.
do not give him want he wants so easily, because it will give him too much control faster than what you want.
it is strange that someone so young is answering questions on here.
if you would like to, you can have intercourse.
do not allow a man to control you.
did you trap him or did he volunteer to tell you?
should you really marry a guy who has been accused of two attempted murders?
you have to accept the truth, sad as it is.
if she seems shy, that means she probably likes you a lot.
i would even give away my soul, but not if it's unrequited love.
make them take a lie detector test that's not a fake.
i'm having a bad day too.
even on silent mode, he'll see the missed calls.
where is your home?
ask to take her to dinner.
in actuality, however, they are simply a negative experience.
phone sex is an alternative to having sex.
decide where you are going to live once you talk to her.
i don't believe that would be at all useful.
she favors dyeing her hair various colors.
your time and your life!
do it for him
in the event its size makes occupying the mouth impossible.
how old are you and your mother?
so how do i go about telling them?
some people are just very ignorant.
does he care about relatable subjects or not?
that is not nice if you do that to your friend.
pretty, classy, fine... that's the kinda girlfriend you want.
they don't know how to act because this is new to them.
what are you talking about, you don't know women?
you on instagram or snapchat?
just brush up close and whisper that you want to kiss her
if it's painful when you have sex then maybe somethings wrong...
heroin, don't do it, you'll regret it.
i don't care if you luv him, he needs to go - pronto~
some guys butts look hot in the right pair of jeans.
trust me, the world don't hav a shortage of gorgeous women.
we know him, _num_, me and jj all live near each other and go to the same school as him.
people invent many reasons to explain why they have not found the right person.
it sounds like he needs to mature.
you should let her try a sports' bra on.
i have been nice to her continuously. what else is there to do?
you two broke up so let him take care of it.
this is ur best shot at getting a good answer, for realz.
gab's got it right, there's no way to know what's up.
lol. the muslim question gave me a good laugh.
it was funny watching spider man get thrown for a loop over an upside down kiss.
flip ur thinking so that people don't think ur dumb.
they really love u or they just saying that and giving no backup
it's all just a bunch of dreams is all
things that get me going: hairy chest and chin
he's blowing u off for the same reasons we blow you off
do i have _num_ get over my crush
i accidentally asked her to marry me and she said yes!!!
its not the only things thats true
different men like different things about girls
let her know you need intimacy every now and then
try not to project.
maybe you guys should take a breather for a sec
school is the biz in the _num_ grade.
once u have sex with them. for sure you will love them more.
guys want true and caring girls that cater to their needs i think, thats it.
we met threw his brother
open up dont hold back.
be patient, i think is what it needs
that's really helpful even if its not really necessary
i told him yes!!!!
from what i've been hearing it sounds like he's already got a girlfriend
it doesn't matter what you wear. get dressed up or wear jeans. either is fine
he's a man whole and you should back off
tell him that it is over, in a nice way.
i would never pack a bag for my husband!
you need to find someone else. and stop stalking them.
avoid being idiotic, as i have seemed.
iunderstand as i have the same problem.
it was disgusting when my girlfriend bit my phallus off then proceeded to eat it.
i wouldn't want my boyfriend to have lunch with another woman especially on valentine's day.
obesity is responsible for the second highest amount of deaths in young people.
it will happen again if you find her.
i wish i knew
do a resort vacation. she will like that
don't say nothing about it to her
message me on yahoo messenger at pao__num_
i went through that _num_ years ago
he doesn't think you like him that much, since you only called him twice...
there are so many important things that i think about.
it can't just be about yourself man, you have to make her feel good in the bedroom too.
i know a lot of great guys.
keep looking for that special person and you will find them!
even though it is acceptable, your partner does not need to know everything you think about.
it is more exciting so you're aware, being shy is a hindrance.
i used to do it frequently.
casually place it out there.
there a bunch of liars!
having sex with a friend can really screw things up for your relationship
get a girl who likes the same stuff as you
try it if you really like them
hey, girls... any advice on having sex for the first time?
no, only if you would like your friend to watch as well.
it is difficult being eight years old, right?
the two of you need a marriage counselor or a larger bed.
sex is like air and water, can't live without it.
trust me this can get bad.
they've been in love since they were _num_
they will always talk crap about you behind your back.
grants never have to be paid back.
the internet is a wrong place.
you will not require special shoes.
you can tell that is just friendship if he will not even sit with you.
if he will not perform oral sex, then don't let him have sexual intercourse with you.
who ended the relationship?
i'd say adam and eve, although they were smart.
i'm stunned by how egostistical you are.
it's not hard to make a cake.
no. this is reality and not a chat room.
why not do just this one thing?
why not get with her if he loves her??
tell him hes the boss or just leave his ass
get ur butt to a doctor!!
i dunno if they agree but i feel like im not replaceable
if you wanna surprise them, say you love them
he alway's says he's sorry but then a month later he's lying again!!!
when my bae farts and burps he's just like a government mule
try doing other things that he wouldn't like and that way you'll know if he likes you for you or for what you do
you'll always wonder if you don't tell him the truth
it happened because of fate.
you should love them because god loves everyone, and that should be passed on to others.
you should really think carefully about this before deciding.
it's a moment i'll never forget, it was so strange, i fell right to my knees.
play the selection 'baby, baby, stay gone,' a song by jimmy wayne.
however, i derive pleasure from heavy petting, including even a small amount of stroking.
in the first place, do not do anything unless you want to do it.
i married an attractive, rude man and i later divorced him.
it is only worth it if both of you can wait.
if you do not leave him alone, you might run into some trouble.
love isn't scary, cuz if it is, it's not love. you haven't met the right guy yet, so keep looking and good luck!
you can date whoever you want and get on with your life.
your mom kicked out the wrong person.
ok, don't buy her cheap edible panties if you want the night to be nice.
it's not for you.
do not pressure women as it will not result in a positive response.
yes, but i hope i never have to do so.
we sat on my bed together, and i looked into her eyes before going in for the kiss.
wait. perhaps it is not yet time for you to meet the right person.
the options are to co-exist peacefully with the individual or to not do so.
im no prude. i love watching porn and oral, and i'm also hot as hell
waves usually don't get that large even with rain
u dont wanna have to see his mug again
no, not in actuality. however, if you become impregnated, your baby may be born deceased or suffer deformities and/or illness upon birth.
showing her should cause fewer fights than hiding things.
do not go on another date with her.
if women are not attracted to you because of it. is their own problem.
what will i do with the two of them?
was his boss mean to him?
if you look straight into his eyes, you will get an answer.
just like other men, i too like women younger.
if he needs to kill himself to get over this then so be it.
then, he attempted suicide, and my unintelligent self went to see him in the hospital.
p.a. - i'm not coming down on you in any way.
u should make sure not to let sex ruin a good thing.
believe it or not, dues have feelings sometimes too.
all women are different - just like the dudes.
that has different meanings.
yes, if you stop being lazy.
a man is a man.
lots of dudes are, but not all of them.
there must be a reason for her jealousy.
it is very telling that he doesn't like children.
she did it once.
if you are attracted to males and females, you're therefore bisexually oriented.
i enjoy a man with a round posterior, it's attractive.
what gives, if you're not getting hitched.
say what you want, i like doggie-style.
you think she's hot, then go for it.
start paying him some attention and sho him you care.
i didn;t believe it till i looked into her eyes.
im still with her, we hooked up _num_ months ago and we are still going strong.
if your horney then do the deed.
i hope she dont mind that i had a one night stand before.
i'm just saying that the guy didn't do this to you
having a nice non accusing conversation
i know my boyfriend loves me i hope yours does too
come visit me in romania that's where i live now
if you want to get married, then you should do ti
point is, she's your boss and you had a sexual encounter with her-it is what it is.
he feels bad about it, so i don't think he did.
i realize he's a jerk but he wants to be with me
you wouldnt think bout it if u was her friend!
shes so lucky, congrats to the bride and groom!!
she aint good enough for you anyway
transmit a video recording of you having sexual relations; it's lucrative.
her appearance would not matter.
i do not think that the chickens care.
she had attempted to use the credit cars, she learned they were not working.
in the event she's romantically inclined, obtain a bouquet and candies, despite the conclusion of valentine's day.
do you want people to think you're an idiot?
i need something new and different
you should not have intercourse if you are not aroused, as it will be painful.
no, he merely enjoys conversing with you.
if i were you, i'd wait and see what happens if you think this is going to be heartbreaking....
it cant be love, you dont even know her at all!
totally been there, dude.
how in the world could you do that and then go and tell people allll about it?!
hope ya find your loved one or a new one and it works out for ya!
put some clothes on!
if you don't want a kid, make sure he wraps it
fool me once shame on you. fool me twice shame on me.
dust yourself off and get back out there!
girls also do it.
if a woman looks bad, it's best not to sleep with her.
one day you will find the right person.
when you are in love, you will find some nice meanings.
did she seriously do that to ya?
you get some money and you tell her you got feelings.
go ahead, go for it!
haha, my old yahoo chat name was "iscreamifyoudoitright" lmao
what should u do if your bf doesn't call or txt u in _num_ weeks?
how my wife makes me pay attention lol
they're not happy, soooo something must be missing
ur my most bestest friend ever!
it depends on your age.
it's simple, find someone in the jail who can marry you.
did did not know that untill now.
accomplish the task once you've become betrothed.
you are still going to feel that you are unable to trust men.
girls don't talk about it much.
wanna talk about it?
the times when you can't get 'em out of your head
don't turn back for that dude.
stare into her eyes and grin
she means exactly that
officially im a gemini, but unofficially i don't believe that bs
some guys only want you for your box!
yeah my ex told me the exact thing once.
if all he wanted was to shove his tongue down your throat, he didnt really love you!
you didnt tell me your wife gots kids .
it appears that he has only lukewarm feelings for you.
you can pick someone better.
you will have more temptations rather than being in love.
i do not want to see him again.
perhaps you find a location that is far enough from home, but close enough so your family can visit once a month?
when you can understand each other without even talking.
is it right to say that a woman knows what i want irl.
you will fuck if you love each other.
you should think about getting a job to send him money.
i cant help but think if it was me.
if the relationship doesnt happen what then?
be you, but hush up and don't be a ho
i think that is just not right!!!
yeah love can be after _num_ months
ive got some get some and figure it out
is your butt like a chicken's butt?
men are so good at this, there is simply no comparison!
personality first and foremost, then being in shape, finally, kindness.
you can be interested in whoever you want.
just admit that she does not want to date you.
why not just vex every man?
it is alright, now, yaar.
yes, i believe you should rehome the cat.
that is a good start because you sound attractive.
tto begin, select specifically a single man you're enraptured by.
why man wouldn't date a virgin?
you should really think about it before deciding
you will nevrt be happy with him
it was a man
the right thing, u did.
i want a buddy to chat with.
_num_, my baby is cross-continental.
act like you don't give a...
my boyfriends tend to be stocky.
you should send your ex a valentines' day gift.
when a person is as attractive as you are, it is worth the effort.
you are the only attractive person that i see.
sexual activity with my attractive man (i was not required to provide him to others).
tell him that if he doesn't change your gonna leave and then if he doesn't change leave.
nothing should ever come before you daughter point black
there's someone out there for every one
if i can do it then so can you
ask your bff to do it
any other girls feeling the same???
if he really loves you then he'll wait and don't cheat
you're young kiddo, don't take life too seriously and have fun.
they've got a hard face
yup, hurry up and leave
so long as u are honest and true, love will find u out.
i have to admit that i think about sex all the time and even more than dudes that i know.
go silly or go home - sung as off-key as u can get.
pick up your head and flash those pearly whites.
at the max, around _num_ years older than u.
go to her and tell you that you are the guy she's been waiting for!
there's a bunch more out there than what it seems to be right now.
without regard to whether or not they chuckle on the occasion.
in my head, it did.
all gentlemen are different when it comes to girls; we fall for all types of girls.
it is fine, as long as you have romantic interest in him.
you're developmentally stunted and were you my child, you'd prohibited from socializing with the opposite sex.
i'd help, but nah im lazy lol
the rest is just surface
find someone that treats you the way you deserve
i have been socializing with a very attractive man and our relationship is progressing positively everyday.
i very much love my former lover.
furthmore, avoid the plants that i mentioned.
if she is attracted to you, that would be great.
are you into someone else, just tell me?
what's wrong with discriminating against someone's sexual orientation?
i don't get how people could be into that, it's so creepy.
if they love you they'll show it.
until then, quit being a jerk.
every guy dreams of when she says it doesn't mean anything.
you should also be respectful about it.
do you think you could be sending a bad message?
just let it go and get on.
all girls think different bout things i can see that
what went on with his queen?
depends all on you.
if it matters ands valuable for u, why not try it i guess
i'm uncertain. are you ready?
would you like to date men or women?
you can go as far as you want to go.
if she asks me, i do not know the answer.
what's the reason for your unemployment?
i like him alot.
i asked him how he knew that i was looking at you.
would he be bothered if you asked other men for pictures?
it couldn't have been that bad if they wed in spite of it.
i am letting you know that it was very long.
you'll need help, women are harder to get in the mood.
if you feel the need to ask, you aren't ready to get married.
i never agree with my boyfriends mom.
i am addicted to sex, maybe that's wrong, but i love getting freaky.
their favorite thing is to have their paws on your cash.
i was asked to stay overnight at a girls house i know
let them know if they would've asked sooner but you already have plans
forget what could be and enjoy what is
she won't look at you the same if you dont make her want to impress you.
i can't figure out why i did that in the first place.
i'm not gonna ask him out or anything like that!
my opinion can be dangerous if asked
ask her if you really want to know the answer
being crude doesn't make him look good
ask him if he will have dinner with you.
this is the only sore spot between us
so when you gonna tell me your making this stuff up?
if you don't get asked out by someone you like dont go at all
he probably hates this too.
i’m not quite smart enough for him!
you ever like a girl but not wanna date her?
it would be awful if you broke up after all of that.
you're a total stranger to me.
get out of there and stay out!
if you are gay you can ask god to forgive then you can still go heaven, or so they say.
he's my good friend but only a friend.
learn to spell. i can't understand your ? even.
don't do anyhting you'll feel sorry for later
most likly hes into someone else wont tell uthou
after i drank and smoke!!!
agree w/im no problem but what r ur thoughts bout it?
go after whatever thick u want
look for younger men even though some fifty year old men are good looking.
what is the opposite of being above me?
it's not something that males like to do.
why can you not simply ask her on a date?
she simply is my true love even if she is not considered special by others.
have you ever heard of a pajama party?
do you really enjoy hurting people who are so important to you?
my friend often teases me because of my personality.
no, move on with your life. i have been through this before.
a lot of guys dream about the same thing.
it is not a good idea to date everyone.
i have the same problem.
karma will rear its head on him again.
do not let him see you when you are depressed.
but we are very happy, and we enjoy our lives.
date him on a single occasion and, should you have enjoyed the encounter, then, don't be stupid, maintain his company.
why is it that the more exciting sports have the most contact.
for real, you shouldn’t get him another dog.
if you are having sex with somebody you should love that person.
better to love somebody with some get up and go than to love a loser
asking this question means that you love your wife
if you want to be perceived as a potential girlfriend for someone, you should be genuine.
my breasts are too big for this shirt.
read my questions and answers section. i was in a relationship with a friend of my new girlfriend and i broke up with her.
i am merely his friend. i love him, but he seems not to know.
sex feels great and is one of the most important things a man can do in life.
it's going on right under angelina's nose, right at their pad. that's crazy right?
look is a black guy breaks into my place, it's fair to say blacks are criminals
that night, he just find me not hot or something?
put on some sexy ass outfit, dress to the nines, cook his favorite thing, and then finish off with some freak sex.
initially, his comment in and of itself merely demonstrates the true extent of his character.
it was at least one a week if he did call.
women attracted to other women is not unique. some nourish it, while others allow it to fade over time.
if i wasn't then i'd be with a chick.
hey girls, answer me this - have u ever gone out with a dude u didn't know very well?
if u really have the urge, send one to him too.
i'm guessing it makes for quick access.
chicks don't seem to worry about it as much as dudes.
maybe they're just happy about being together?
i'd give em a toilet brush
ain't no need to keep playing these childish games
that ain't normal for a guy
i'd probably dump him for that
in my opinion, fake boobs suck.
you've woven a big tangled web...
what's hard to get? the dude wanted to screw you...
don't let him get away with it!
was just curious... thanks for the answer!
if neither of you want to have sex then i don't see what the big deal is.
become rabbits and screw whenever you can
it could happen, why not?
or do you truly love me?
seems like you're answering your own question
flirting isn't about acting dumb, ur thinking of sumthin else.
we only live once, we need to have fun _num_ it's too late.
first i comment on their clothing, then i move on from there.
for some reason, he thought i had a good time.
guys like to act tough, but some are almost as sensitive as girls.
leave her and move on.
if you two are meant to be together, love will find a way.
you should not give him another chance to hurt you.
you can of course, but are you sincere?
women want a challenge. not a man who they can easily control.
observe his how he acts.
i would not date someone again after we broke up.
it is the holy grail.
be careful and use protection.
remember it's your decision. you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
it's not really a bad thing.
live your life took my time slow your progress
forgive and forget sparingly.
if a man doesn't care he doesn't care.
oh man do it doesn't matter if they're married either.
he’s been trying to avoid me.
divorce will negatively affect children.
try to do one good thing a day.
you should look for a person closer to your age
guys never want to be "just friends" with a woman...
that's on both of y'all
since you are sorry, you should do it.
it's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean...
i am in my mid-twenties and still inexperienced.
if it's unimportant, then why is she dating another woman?
have some patience and give him a chance to get to know your children.
if they are in love with each other, then they will live together.
yes you can. did you miss the day they mentioned that in sexual education class?
believe me, everything that glitters aint gold and people are not always who they seem to be
i want to hug him everytime i see him
you think of him everytime that song comes on
he thinks im lying
dont sweat that, no worries!
things will get lots better when you get adulted.
he's gonna find another but its like you want something alot more.
if you get stocks and bonds you will become richerer.
from your statement it seems you are just living in fantasy land dr checko (nickname)
speak it loud and proud and let come what may.
stupid is worse than foolish
skin color shouldn’t be a factor
tell her to wait.
he just wants to be friends
don't get involved with that drama. save yourself
make him think you're interested in his best friend
they're getting along better now i think
this cant be done through email
if i get dumped its my fault
if she'd pay attention she'd know
its better to just say stop
i'd encourage her to think again.
i don't think so, ya'll girls is scared.
tell him you ain't listening if it ain't your way
when i first hooked up with matt, i liked jon but didn't know he liked me too.
same as why men do it.
better men will like you if you dress better.
she will know we slept together.
dumb question, cuz if you don't know, you never will.
sure, u might love him but do u really want to risk him giving u an std?
i'm needing a lot of answers, so let's get on with this
who cares what his butt looks like if he treats you well
so they don't wanna be ur friend anymor?
they are a substancial part of your life.
a talk might help, some men get weirded out by commitment and marriage.
almost all married men are happy.
tell her her parents love hereven if they dont live with each other
tell her u been there and he gave you vd
start off by saying hi and move into easy talk after that
i asked if he liked me still and he said no
just do what you like doing
no, he doesn't even know her. they met online.
no that's the opposite of normal.
you might make it worse if you try to force it.
if he doesn't like her she needs to just move on.
it's gonna be all bad.
you have somebody with whom to share both your good and your bad moments.
determine whether or not she returns your email missive or discover the result personally.
it is possible that the flowers might be too strong.
you two should have sex frequently.
sentence: you already know the answer.
if u wait it out, good things will happen.
if your chick loves u, your past should not be a problem.
no problem with this if he joins in and it's _num_ together then okay but otherwise no way.
usually it's the one who ain't so good in the sack.
do not attempt to impress her. simply let her know that you are interested in her.
my virginity was forsaken at _num_ years of age; i was genuinely unaware of the reason underlying the excess of hyperbole.
do u have conversations with people in the yahoo chat rooms?
if you have feelings for his friend instead, you should tell him.
i do not like skinny women.
i don't understand why men feel the need to cheat on their partners.
just tell me what it is that girls want from guys.
why are people putting so much at risk just to get laid?
some people behave in such a depressing way.
if you wait too long, chicks will get leary.
is that you giving u trouble?
ahem!!!....do yall plan to let me know whats going on in this discussion or not?!
throw a party so she can meet all new folks.
it aint bad if hes _num_ and your _num_
you have to remember 'food' and 'sex' if you want to attract your husband's attention and have sex.
you may find a tall beautiful blonde but she will not be smart.
ask a question and you might get the answer.
was it her personality that made you fall in love?
trust me, you will regret it later in life.
talk to him, ur wasting time!!!!
lol the best way to get divorced is to get married
u know what hes up to but u dont do anything about it
u dont know how old he is????
u can fall in love in _num_ months i did
simply tell him you respect yourself.
i am interested in a woman who attends the same school as me.
do you have dreams about her when you sleep at night?
talk to a friend if that does not work.
ido not even converse with other men.
great way to start the day!!!
i would love to have a picnic somewhere quiet and private! it would be beautiful!
ask questions about where he works, does he work a lot, etc.
we all do it!
ya, me too. know what you mean.
if you dont know, ask her.
i want a pure girl as i am also virgin.
don't say too much!
in any case, their personality needs to be something i can tolerate.
don't worry, when you get older it will make more sense.
it's obvious, theyre sex addictz
please don't let her die!
you can be someone's puppy dog if you choose to do that.
if you like him, let him know loudly, if you don't, just say no.
men, men, men, everywhere in the world.
give it up and look for someone else cuz you guys won't get hitched anyway.
you need to sign one everyday with each other.
you are welcome to join the party, as i believe everyone has the right to enjoy my girlfriend stripping.
don't worry about fickle things.
unless, of course, if was a good dream.
love can lead to heart ache.
why do i have to be of some religion to go to a wedding?????? what?????
heal ur heart find a good dude
u dont need allll the ladys just ooooonnnnneeee
yeah he was all flirty no wonder
get her phone number.if she doesn't give you it, then she's not into you.
in my opinion, it's a woman being grown up.
get rid of him, just because you love him, doesn't mean he loves you too.
that's none of your business!
i think for myself, too.
lol means laughing out loud
is it cool for me to smash my girl?
who knows what will help. try checkin for girls
if you like 'em, don't let some other woman worm her way in there
scratched his head and said he was just kidding as he threw a banana at the screen
i'd get with her even if she'd just been with him, if you know what i mean
act proper and do what your heart wants
just ask her out for something casual
you can't have a wedding in jail.
you need to say hi.
first, they are just like you, so don't call them dumb and ugly.
my sister means the world to me but she puts herself in dangerous situations with men.
you have to make your trip to iraq, but keep in touch so i know you're ok.
find a way to get taller like standing on furniture or just learn to walk on stilts!
no, it is just because he is such a player.
i love you more than anyone else in the world.
most people don't really go there.
has anyone had sex with their spouse before marriage?
there is nothing shameful about sex.
you can surprise him!
your story is similar to a television series.
just like maybe their husbands just aint good enough
oh, i dont think it was any big deal
your love of a person is for who they are, not their race
i quit it and started the rec team, it was way more fun
thing is women who smell like crap think that they dont
life is adventure and we are not getting younger.
he looks at other women and lies when i catch him.
you are right, but she will kill me if i do not do it.
don't get involved in their disputes.
only if both of you have a bromance.
what should i do so i do not scare her away?
of course, if you are over the age of eighteen.
socialize with your companions from younger days in order to become acquainted with alternative unmet companions.
people who do not understand it are most likely brainwashed.
it is not very attractive, in my opinion.
all i believe is that i agree with you.
hmm, if you lack the knowledge, i'll not inform you.
i am a man, and i know what actions you should take.
i like the song 'sex and candy.'
perhaps she possesses the similar emotions that you possess.
to me, i feel like he don't trust you.
sorry to say no but, go get a job.
no need to get married... just be some ones bed buddy.
looking for advice? don't do it!
just be tru to urself and dont let him try to use u
i know it sounds weird but try watch a gay porno and a straight one!
if a woman can marry a dolphin, nothing's impossible!
if it's meant to be, it's meant to be....just be yourself and be honest and confident!
i like it when guys hit on me... it makes me feel so confident
act polite because you aren't right now.
he can't stop cheating.
i would never have my gf wait.
he loves me and never cheated and wouldn't.
i tell my bf that i'm super into him all the time.
want to come check out the cock pit?
the best is when the girl is on top and the lights are on!
well, she she might have dumped you because you're a jerk
i cannot even believe he's talking to you right now
the most important thing is to have fun!
they ain't playing sexual games
i can't get enough sex, i love it.
i like talking to him and don't feel good unless i do
we a bit special around here
that's most awesom... still alot way to go..
there's some one better out there. go get him girll let em hear you roarrrrrr!!!!!!!!
give the men some mystery to ya but not a whole lot.
she's my wife i'm speachless :) :)
as long as you're with a responsibile person you're fine
you'll get married when you're ready
write him a note
it doesn't matter how old you are. just run
you should tell him about the call.
it works for me to be honest.
he wasn't thinking about how you feel.
you'll get over him. time will heal all.
i've taken the plunge _num_ times and have _num_ kids
he's marrying a chick, right?
ask nicely why she hadn't called for so long
the girls you chill with aren't good for you
what can you do if he's really cute?
she'll think you're hiding something if you don't tell her.
that's a lie because if you are really in love then it doesn't matter what happens.
or you could just spread rumors about her everywhere.
shame on you, she's done it again.
you're doing the right thing, divorce him and move on with your life
go ask her out!
we have _num_ small kids so i cant play with him long.
they shouldnt be around babies, they have diseases
everyone has something they dont like about thier appearance
you are not asking anything.
life is great, that is the answer!
if there is nothing better to do.
where do you live?
maybe he doesn't want to have a conversation with you.
young friends are the fountain of youth
give it to her at dinner
a boy friend that is his friend too.
tell him that your baby really needs him.
you get what you pay for in this life.
but they still want to have sex with you.
everyone is attracted to other people so don't worry.
my grammie tells the story way better!
yep, men fantasizes about sex more than girls do.
just be honest, you are all thinking about it.
just wait and see how things shake out.
unfortunately, thing don't get better at the end.
what do you wanna do now?
people don't give a crap about others.
man up and go to the wedding!
my bestie is a guy and we never did more
you should be pissed
ask them when they r taking that lie detector test
not in my case
you wont find love online
you should ask the girl to be your date to the dance.
you able to do many things.
what are you waiting for? pursue him!
play with his friend.
do you perspire much?
tell him to come his eyes to make you comfortable.
if he is so con conceited, he isn't worth your love.
you gotta talk to him and tell him to stop.
why would you ask a dumb question
your _num_ old already has a dad.
_num_ but almost _num_ how old r u?
hey, a girl should like you for who you are.
you wanna find more of these people? then go to henderson north carolina
well, if you're doing other stuff with the guy anyway,you might as well have sex with him too.
we can't read your mind, u know.
some individuals necessitate some motivation.
if that doesn't work, then i don't have any other answers.
it saddens me to say this, but she was unfaithful to you when you were still in a relationship.
if shes into the beaches think about going to the bahamas some weeknd
it's def gonna happen if you truly to love her
dont inflict pain on yourself
youll never be able to match a womans style, so dont buy her clothes unless she picks it
no hurry just wait and be chill
you take it slow and try to make it as close to perfect as possible.
don't play games, you won't be successful.
you will get pleasure form it.
jon and i used to be close, and talk frequently.
she might be honest with you and let you know that she really does not want to be with you anymore.
let your folks know you love 'em and keep on living!
sorry to say, but i have no idea where he could be.
pooches are just like members of the fam ... take it from me, i'm in the know.
how do i help her along in losing weight?
they've got a bunch of terrific ideas in that place.
do notmlet anyone tell you anything different.
yes, the buttocks of a man are important in whether or not he is attractive.
a simple method for communicating his desire for a mere rendezvous.
i couldn't ever hurt anyone i care for.
i think it is mixed.
some man might ask why all girls are slutty.
don't run, and tell him to slow down.
so if that's true, what should i do for her?
i get it. i already said that.
he still wouldn't care if he knew it.
when you are on the cruise, push her over the rail.
it how you do when, when you're in it
another mans trash is another persons treasure
chances are, i will never find him.
my home boy says she is playing you.
never done a dude that idnt have a hot bod
no bra is not hot tell her to
just call and ask
i really get off on dated bisexual women
you better give your man some space, they don't like feeling possessed.
yo, i like women from italy
for that one, i'd give you _num_ points
keep your head up and never give up, even if things don't go your way.
caring is listening if he talks about it
just going to be friendly about it
yikes huge problems to be with a chick in jr high!
you're incorrect concerning that selection. personal concerns, yes?
my advise for you is don't go out with a stranger.
the chances are slim.
if you are ok with it, do not second guess it.
this could be so much worse.
it should be acceptable as long as you think its fine.
even if he is volunteering to do it, he still needs to be questioned and watched carefully.
a real man isn't afraid of 'love'.
we didn't really have a choice but to go our separate ways but i do love him still.
follow your instincts, they may seem wrong but they'll lead you to the right place.
having sex with a man with a small dick was awful!
what made you like doing it?
if we were looking for fun we hit certain hot spots at night.
i have heard that sometimes it happens where friendships lead to something more romantic.
i know all about boys, if you have questions.
i love phone sex with my boo
you gotta learn how to read between the lines, know what i mean?
buy something that he would like to see on you.
you drew them in with your affection.
i would just like to be his friend.
i hope things work themselves out.
lots of men dont like to be bossed arounf
he shouldnt b putting you down dont let it get to u life is just too short to be affected by stupid boys
my partners eyes yes i am
you both know way too much about each other already.
i can't tell you why, but i was into a chick like that before.
you could just act like he's dead to you.
don't even think about forgiving him!
your are dangerous and don't even know it.
look him in the eyes that is all you need.
i like a good kisser and good sex.
you have no idea about what you want in life.
it's dependent upon yourself. however, is it something you'd desire to have happen?
if the man is going to marry the woman, she must have not had intercourse with too many other men.
it must be an element contained in the water!
what type of friend are you searching for?
no, maybe he would like to speak to you before he goes to sleep.
its like the only thing that is more important than health for people
youre totally getting used by them
once you bang him, he'll be wrapped around your finger
just banging someone is meaningless, but actually being with somone you love means something
its totally true, and i do the same thing at times
because some men forget themselves when they are in the presence of attractive women such as myself.
that is one of the main topics, when women get together.
perhaps you're interested in bad boys?
you can do better, most likely.
whenever you see her, have her view the best of you.
personally want my daughter to be gay, know how men are
not worth ur time and thoughts
how to tell him im prego and not have him flipp out
step one kissing, then the rest
it just depends on her. i lie all the time and everyone believes me.
the embarrasement level shouldn't be concerning.
your nose + her privates!!
this lady's jerk of a husband was abusing her kids!!!
if he gets you that upset it's time to move on.
if he understands, stay.
u might want to stay his friend.
i have no clue who you met.
how'd u feel if ur future hubby cheated on u?
ur smiles don't cost anything.
some person will find you if not
your gonna have to live with it even if you say sorry because he's not gonna come back.
your related to my spouse so im just like your friend.
they think their's hope cause their in love.
i aint on the list.
if you know you can trust your man, no worries.
i cant think of any reasons.
even if a guy is over _num_ that can still be hot and chill.
should i go back to that place or just stay home?
why are you with this guy????
i gained _num_ pounds or so said my scale
just one way you can find love!
what i want is someone married so i can have fun with no strings.
i'm _num_ and still out there looking.
you only marry if you want to spend the rest of your life with this man!
there is a chance of a small part of her that does not, but most likely she does.
that is impressive and we ought to thank him every day for the wonderful feelings of arousal.
it depends on whether or not you believe in books on dream meanings, i suppose.
i got a great idea you can move to new zealand.
i'll enjoy the candy & roses... but what will u be doing then?
i didnt even know what that word meant!? my freind had to tell me.
he hasnt been with anyone seriously for a long time.
how did i ever waste so many years with scumbag like you!!!!
if she ain't their supervior, it's all good
some people just crazy out there.
i can't wait to do the same to her
if someone isn't asked out, do they become unattractive.
marriage ain't no joke
obviously he doesn't accept who you are, don't stay with him and be miserable because of it.
do your sexy dance for him.
i want to do things to you that i wouldn't even do to chocolate cake.
would anyone lie about being _num_?
don't hide, you might loose them!
give it some time, it has only been six months.
do not have children if you want to participate in coitus for more than five minutes.
he would not have cheated if he did it.
most likely, she still lives with her parents.
why, does it matter to you?
u can't help greaming, frantisizing, it's only that.
and it makes some people jealous, so b careful bout that.
i'd never post that kind of personal info.
you can't worry about pleasing others, just yourself.
your insticts are always the best sign if you are doubting him.
am i to believe he doesn't have a legitimate reason to dislike you?
iam curious now, too, so what was that about?
has that happened to you before?
in the event this young man is fond of you, you'd be best to accompany him.
tell him u like him thru ur friend
not over yet nope
youve got to be smart about it
get even by being a better person than before w/them
omg dont go up to him and tell him you want to have his sis- no!!!!
if you act like a woman, you might get lucky.
my husband and i hooked up when i was _num_ that was almost _num_ years ago.
you have to hang with him for a while to see what he's all about.
its always great in the beginning but eventually the magic wears off
i'm busy and can't talk right now
they can't stay away from each other long
give her a phone card or a vday card?
ask him what he wants to do with his life
get to kno her
sometimes you don't realize you like someone until they express interest so its worth a try
im pretty sure shes into me becaue all of our flirting and that we talk constantly
i dont wanna bug anyone
just hooking up with someonen doesn't mean you have to date them
it depends on the man because it is not all guy.
a sense of humor is important.
please repeat after me. you are a dishonest jerk.
do it in public.
tell him that you love him.
it is human nature to want to be loved.
once you move on, then you will not mind whether he moves on or not.
because pain is akin to pleasure, and when one bleeds, one experience a feeling similar to sexual release.
just come out and tell them...that's the best way to do it.
may you be preserved by god and your fellow soldiers
you know what need to be done...you gotta forgive em.
once a cheater, always a cheater!
tell the awful woman that you hate her and she needs to back off.
i only care about what type of person she is now.
realize that mother and father are happy being separated.
incorrect, however your beauty appears greater to him after sundown due to your father being asleep, lol.
sometimes it is very unfortunate, but it will happen when it is meant to happen.
want to get hitched to me?
this is a problem i have had many times, just keep them both happy and stick with them.
it he wants to be friends, then thats it.
you are usually happy and glowing
marriage is better, but its not easy either.
men of a certain nature love to listen to them.
she will probably catch on if you kiss her on her cheek, and she may carry on from there!
if hse ignors you, she is not worth your time.
if you love someone then you sacrifice being with anyone else.
do not center your life around her.
what is her favorite restuarant?
now you receive two of everything.
i don't agree that woman should approach first.
go take a bath and relax
dont' worry about being serious right now.
i wouldn't worry about it i cant believe he even told you he's dumb lol
if you are truly in love, you should not want anything other than that.
in the event my husband were unfaithful, i'd most likely sever his genitals and display them upon the rear-facing mirror of my mustang vehicle.
love is a weird thing for guys.
refrain from corrupting your spiritual security for anybody.
i have a significant amount of excitement to live for.
open it, and ask her.
inform him that you maintain your feelings in love for them using any possible method.
make it appear as though you are interested in her in another way.
bf is all up into watching chicks while drivin he thinks i dont see it
just treat him like a friend u havent seen in forever
would you do it with more than one person at the same time????
dude is leading u oooooonnnnn
in the event i genuinely give it some consideration, i want a relationship with the pair of them, i imagine.
please dream of me, then date me.
what do you find attractive in a woman's looks or words?
the feeling of like goes both ways between me and him
although, i waz crazy about this guy,when he embarrassed me in front of a ton of people, i am not sure how i feel.
kick him to the curb, it might wake him up.
if it feels right, then it is okay
hey, did i tell you lately, that i am sweet on you?
how do i go on without him, i care so much!!!
i really rather be able to talk to someone.
shit, its a roller coaster.
if you want to be her side piece then it would be fine.
cover it up, or you will get knocked up.
maybe you just need to be alone with a man
is it far away?
if you're both naked and in bed, it's gonna end up being sex together.
if you truly like him, you will simply know.
stop trying to control her life.
my man tells me it gives him the opportunity to tell me that i am attractive.
you should stop and think about how that makes you look in front of his friends.
it does not matter who she was, even if it was a stripper.
maybe they should get married now.
you’re man isn’t really you’re man.
i love only having myself to think about!!
don't let no man find out, they be hatin'
tell him everything related.
just b careful if he's the sort of asshole who can't understand.
yeah, the sense of humor is necessary, and confidence, and kidness.
i won't want _num_ the _num_ man if she starts to think about number _num_
he's sweet, but is terrible at thinking right.
pick me, but be specific about the category or stereo type. how old is important too!
why does she just want to watch?
i don't like hurting other people.
because for her taking it out when times are tough and it's difficult
i've been datin my bf over a year and he still lies all the time.
you think you did it on purpose?
if we were lying you'd know it. trust us.
you should ask her why she's staying in that relationship if she feels that way about you
they just like to make you hurt
to answer your question, men are from mars so you can't make any sense of them
i love love love my baby daddy <_num_<_num_<_num_
it seems you've already decided to have sex with him
i wish they would treat us with respect.
of course that made me extremely angry.
are you suppose to sign that?
it is a narrow way of thinking that god does not care about sexual proclivities.
a simple little wedding in the yard worked for me.
i'm glad i married him, but people are freaking out about it.
even though your heart wants it, if your gut says to get out, do it.
somebody who cheated once will do it again.
you need to wait until you hear her side of the story.
maybe he thinks it's your fault you have a kid.
no offense to the good guys.
i'm not sure about that.
don't tell your girl to be a stripper.
my bff went out w a really short dude and they even made out.
he’s not cheatin if he says he is.
she luvs u like a brotha
why would i go thru his stuff if i did?
he's not lonely at all.
no that means you are the one i want.
get rid of him and end it.
i heard a coat vaccuum will do the job.
dump him and don't listen to his garbage excuses. he doesn't love you
you just can't see beyond her looks, can you??
if you don't call him now, he might disappear forevah.
it's fun to be a little naughty sometimes, can't be good all the time.
hello??!! we have hormones too nitwit!
unless you have soem hidden doubts - the answer is no.
honey, i love you with all my heart.
there are better things you an do with your life then try to understand men.
you need to relax for awhile.
sometimes i travel back to my hometown to get away. my hometown is located across the country from where he is.
be sexually intimate before you go to sleep.
say yes if you are interested in him and no if you are not.
if i had to choose, i would choose african american, because caucasian men just do not attract me.
that depends on whether he prefer war games, sports games, et cetera.
i no longer want to be in a relationship with him.
they are loved because if they were not then they would not find it.
the coaches were way cool to let me stay in more than half the game.
they think differently than you do.
it can make your relationship wayyyy better.
keep at it until you get to level _num_
hit me up cuz i speak the idiots, grunts and jabberwockys languages.
you can go to uk and see what the answer is.
most girls don't like him lol on campus.
guys like to look at our boobs.
if you dump your girlfriend she will be so surprised.
speak up and don't be shy.
you can give her a nice gift, and ask her then.
how can i respond if i do not know your gender?
do not worry and be mean about it because love is not rare.
she should make a decision, so she can prevent getting pregnant.
you better get rid of that cheater
start at the first moment of you wedding
i don't discriminate when it comes to the gender of my friends
no need for shades you future is not bright
it's time to have a convo if you don't think they're ready to commit
i love wearing heels so a guy i date will have to deal with it.
it may break his heart to realize you don't love him but he will be ok.
you knew he was not a talked when you got married so why expect him to talk now.
it is online everywhere i look.
do not sleep together if you have not already.
what kind of father does that make him?
spend time with a man who has some rough edges.
the problem is, i am not sure if she feels the same for me.
i do not like emotionally weak people, though.
she loves you like a brother.
bad teen movies is the only place that works.
he would never leave his wife for her.
if you need to just stay with your sister.
going w/a friend has always worked out for me
think hes into me or playing me?
that language is horrible
how to reject someone & still be friends?
i like to spoon, other's don't
shut the door when she came over.
fun and romantic kinda love
have u seen the movie the game?
dont say i love you too early on
i would like to be done with work.
it takes time to remember the good times and forget the bad.
i saw them last year, and they were very good.
she is not even in college yet and the two of you would like to have a serious relationship?
you could e-mail him if you cannot do that.
you begin to want her more if you think about her more often.
i occasionally think only about coitus.
it ought to be elaborate, public, and demonstrate her importance to you. you should attempt it.
that will make it worse.
mybe you thought there was more love then there was when you got married.
if that person hurst you, you will have another to be there for you.
tell her to try asking him to hang out with her or something.
he is hooking up with some whore.
if she isn't faithful, let her go because she ain't worth it.
if you like him, you should hook up with him.
she cannot hinder you from visiting with your child.
nno man would bribe you to kill your child.
u should stop calling and see if he misses you.
rreprimand your daughter for her bad behavior.
it may have been communicated in the same manner as you informed us.
if i did not have children, i would die for the one i love.
why do so many men want to live with asian women?
help me answer the question what needs to be done.
go out with one of her closest friends, and treat her like a queen.
tell her to not date bad guys.
a lot of my friends gfs ask me the same thing
im trying to figure it out
kiss him and see how u feel
my bf loves my toes
you need to do it now who knows when you’ll see him again
this guys recommends to take it slowly
do you even hear yourself right now?
u need to let him know what u want to lead him along.
u mean he can't convince a chick to share hers with him?
u lose interest quick like when u are with either of them.
u know what u need to do.
my magical toy says it is so.
one day i just sat him down and told him how i felt about him.
she wanted to know how i was feeling.
it really just depends on how long you've been dating.
if you had known, you would have tried to be just that.
you’re in soooo much trouble.
she’ll do it when she feels like it.
it should be ok.
it’ll take forever just to pick out the dresses!!!
things started to change later that month.
tt is not okay and just because he is male does not make it right.
i would choose jamookae. he has serious mental problems.
i will try to kiss her next time.
i want to put in my _num_ cents.
i don't understand why anyone would kill a baby.
she's really not attracted to you like that.
just chill out and let her know you are into her.
if they don't seek you out, it just wasn't meant to be.
step _num_: do this if you don't see results after _num_ weeks
in most cases, he's uncomfortable in the outfits you like.
however, i'm not the one who did anything wrong -- i love him so much, what should i do?
remember, just cause he knows ur involved don't mean he wont try.
roses are red violets are blue.
do what u gotta do- it's not wrong.
maybe his wife doesn't seduce him like before.
i care, but it's not everything.
don't worry bout it, he'll understand.
runaway and merry that person you cant live without.
theres plenty of fish in the sea, just forget about that person and find someone new.
to feel something you hafta take the hole bottle.
if one did not enjoy using intimate toys, than apparently it did not help them.
apologies, it's will remain forever uncomfortable and somewhat oddball-ish.
how do i get it to come out?
i would help if i knew her.
not just honest, but honorable too. i don't cheat or pretend to care.
i like my teachers, but i'm not one.
i had boyfriends even though i wear glasses.
if i met the woman for whom i have been searching, then she would be all i need.
that was after i caught him cheating.
do not make yourself seem cheep. married men are not avaliable!
i enjoy dreaming of different men, which i suppose is acceptable.
spring it on him in private.
thirty is young to be so fat.
get out now n be free. no wishy-washy.
you are wet behind the ears.wait until you are older.
you been had. he's a user.
if they're not at the pet stores are definitely at the barns.
if you have somebody else already then let him go so he can get somebody to.
if i knew i'd be right there.
i don't think we know each other well enough to be in love
it's too late you blew it with her
i think she preoccupied and won't notice if someone else likes her.
so, you say that you are attracted to a lesbian but you are not a lesbian yourself. that does not make any sense.
i will talk to you later about this.
show him what you like, instead of telling him.
mosy guys would liek a chance if you are not married.
tell her to move on with her life
you won't be able to do it
if he really doesn't know the women. then it shoudln't matter
he'll love u more
my wife gave me a peck, then took off with the kids
my email's _num_@yahoo.com, i like new ppl
i dunno, maybe i just can't lie much
matt made it easy for me to decide on him.
the beach sounds good, but so does dinner at a nice restaruant.
that's not enough to tell you he doesn't love you......hand in there.
when people pretend to not be insterested when they really are, they are just playing games with you.
i was born to do it doggy style.
the other saturday i had to pretend to be both a male and female six times.
it will be hard if he doesn't notice you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
you should hit him on the head.
if you have to ask questions of that nature, then, you should go out and get that job.
talk to him first.
dont think alot bout it
then i come back and its the same shit
even if ur a beginner if she likes u wont matter
um yeah, need to break up w/him
asked her to dance now were friends!
i reccommend that you call her and inform her of your feelings for her.
it is good that you are experiencing new things.
what they said is true.
you will loose it if you do not use it.
do not be late, someone else may take the opportunity.
ok, but are you in love?!?
but he says he don’t care about you.
get someone else to tell him for you.
i believe he was a friend once.
you sister may have a suitable solution for you problem.
that depends on your gender.
are you implying that i am not a good person?
earth chock full o girls
drop it and have you sum fun
if you like her whats it matter.
why she miss someone that dont beling ta her.
no one can ever be exactly what you are.
you feel them, not see them.
do not worry about those types of things.
it is exciting, especially when he makes you feel the way that you do.
as a male, i think it relates to sex.
why are men stronger, tougher, and more honest and hardworking?
aquery which resulted in your hysterical reaction.
you should not marry her, she is using you to her benefit.
you will need good luck.
dont ask him out, drive him crazy until he asks you
look over the pics of young guys
one of _num_ possibilities, ur boring, hes wanting a break, or hes sleeping with someone else
you can do this if you want but you shudnt.............. you deserve so much better
not sure cuz my fiance and me are both like that
she will love you all the more if you love and trust her.
i make so much noise our neighbors have made complaints against us.
well, he won't be in a marriage for a significant future period.
i think the same thing about wrestling.
you will feel it, and that is when you will know.
correct, it is the french that was being employed by all. however, this also serves the purpose.
if you find the answer to that question, please let me know.
are there any other concerns that you shouldn't attempt to date him.
listen to your intellect and emotions.
jealousy is a difficult emotion to overcome.
imho, it would be neat.
i'm a guy; you can trust me hon.
for sure, ask ur big sister again
read this story and then say whatever you can to get her to stop!!!!!
my bf is not like that. he just starts and goes to town on it lol.
check my ?s click on my avatar - identical!
hes just got a shitton of chick friends im lost
i think having a bae is awesome!
one day, just plant a kiss on him!
i want her back bad bad bad!
at least hes including you!
seducing a woman is like winning a trophy, dude.
tell him to eff off.
get a valentine's day rose bouquet for her and invite her on a date.
there's no rule that says you have to ask her to be your girlfriend.
if you think he is attractive and have feelings for him, try asking him out.
if it is during intercouse, i do not think that she is a virgin.
you can contact me at _num_@hotmail.com, then we can talk about this more later.
there is not even free lunch, or even fireworks.
i enjoy receiving advice.
its toughto talk w/her
srsly asking via text- messed up
plannin is a good thing just not too much
you are her life
_num_ time i had to help someone like this... help!
its not fair that a guy cant talk to another chick without his gf thinking he's cheating
i chatted with the guy for like _num_ hrs.
that means u like yourself
no matter what stand up for yourself!!!
it's the same reason why a lot of women are slow.
try that & your life will be over!
i have a desire to but i don't want to w/o thinking.
each week is not the same..before all else look for signs like eye contact & flirting
love conquers all in the end so dont be worried sweetie!
trust me i am a pro at relationships
i make sure i ask a guy out if i am interested, don't need any other woman scooping him up
well that takes time to develop
remember even unattractive men like bill gates can still land a woman
god says to love one another, he doesn't judge it by gender.
when men go out in public they want a nice girl on their arm but when they get home, they want a tiger in the bedroom
i'm not certain but i think if you show him you care and cook him diner it may work.
either ask him or one of your friends.
she's not that into you.
it's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean.
i don't care about my boyfriend's stuff.
you should hook up with his friend and see how he likes that!
you need to work on that.
let's do something fun after school.
it's time to get serious with her she's acting like a _num_ yr old.
men suck at lieing, women are much better at it.
everyone thinks you are a jerk.
once you do that, see if he still wants to be around you.
you cannot just force yourself on anyone, or you will end up with noone.
do not act as though you are pure.
i suggest that you introduce yourself.
i will try anything once, and i will do it again if i enjoy it.
he is more wise cuz he's _num_-_num_ years older.
sesriously!? you want to be with that kind of person for the rest of your everlastin' life???
i think if your gut says something is off, then it's off.
don't be an idiot, try to be normal in the brains department.
nowadays, almost everyone has gone past _num_ base with sex.
bottom line, it's pickin' my future mate.
both are fine, but it will just depend on how we are feeling that day
he a liar and hangs up in the middle of when im talking.
if you take too long, youll never get anywhere
is he being stupid and ruining his life?
nah but whose really happy anyways
do you like someone asking you for a date?
everything reminds me of him and what it used to be.
although you said it was mutual, i expect he would go to jail here.
after one month, i can fall in love.
if you don't find him trustworthy, then how can you two love each other?
lol he keeps trying to make me jealous like why?
what are they gonna say?
if you rent make sure someone gets pic and video
thanks i'll let him know she'll do it again im sure
i'm not worried about it
are u guys still a thing??
like it or not.. fake it till u make it!
set the mood with some barry white stuff. it works.
not required to have a relationship.
i'm a _num_ year old girl.
too much of a good thing can be bad.
you just want to be you.
it's ok to cry if you talk to her.
it's about the one you're with.
become friends with the women first, it my thought.
i'd be upset if i got that same kiss today
my girlfriend is my love, my everything, she is perfection.
it ain't easy to find friends.
my ex did that same shit to me
a small amount of each.
act normal and see the results
you're gonna say "you're not able to hurt me no more" when you get mad.
go and get those breasts reduced and youll look slick!
there's none left for you, pal.
if someone wanted to send me nude pics, i wouldn't dump my gf for them.
he's only talking to you, don't run away.
its tacky to cheat on someone then write a note about it.
do not speak with him, he is not the man for you. he's giving you terrible advice.
i made the right choice because i see him once in a while.
he is a _num_-year-old guy who is a virgin.
it is dependent upon whether or not you still care for her.
you should not be having sex in the first place.
it is alright for you to like him even if others do not.
he even had intercourse with the wife of his best friend.
they are very nice.
and what does it mean?
who can assemble me again?
imo definitely no! unless ur bestie tells u its ok
just leave them alone ur not getting anywehre wit them
the way i see people is the way i want to see them
i didnt want to feel so lonely anymore thas y i did what i did
i bet they feel the same way bout girls
not all girls, but some sure do.
yea, if they won't answer the question, or get mad....red flag!
if he truly loved you, he would have supported your choice, no matter what. not talk you into getting an abortion.
wait, what did he say? that he didn't love you?
i wish you were here with me.
why do men continuously lie?
don't waste time with her mind games, move on!
make sure you're clean and tidy.
don't hang out with loosers.
watch what you're doing or you'll be sorry later.
my life would be complete if i married the woman of my dreams.
i have gone to a few before.
i have hung out with big dudes.
contrary to popular belief, most dudes are not dumb.
mine is wayyy huge!
you should know if she digs you, bro.
are you sure this is what you want?
he wasn't meant for you if he walks away.
when are you going to watch the paris hilton video?
i want a man i can love.
both of you need to be understanding and flexible.
i don't like a lot of hair on a man's chest but a little is ok.
just tell your family that he makes you happy.
you should be there for her if she thinks she looks good
nope, i waited til i got asked out.
he has a wife!
tell them how you feel, and see if they feel the same.
you have every right to be mad.
do you really want to be with someone who has no clue of what he wants?
my friends don't like him, and always make fun of him.
you are big time evil
the hard part is getting him to stay with you
so text him aleady!
your a sinner if you aint a virgin
i getg he's like _num_ to _num_, so what about you?
attractive, happy and mature describes you
sometimes men do bad things
dont bring it all covered in hair
look for someone who wants to spend the rest of their lives with you
he loves u because u are his one
he prob thinks its a good thing
b.o., farting, and burping completely turn me off!
i still think alot about him after all this time
see what he says... ask him out
it was a completely different time with differnt gurls
you can't change them... trust me!
you don't need him or anyone else to put you down
i was a virgin on our wedding night so i no he loves me more
get a plane ticket and go get married if ur really in love!!
watching a woman masturbate turns me on and i like to have sex with her right after
why don't you tell her how you really feel.
men can't be friends like women can.
just be a cool dude and don't take girls for granted all the time.
deep inside u r strong!!!
shell make a move and break off the realtionship
how long have u been married?
ask him if hes willing to put family into a priority position
that's another story altogether!
would i show my hubby the door?
i hear that men want women who have never done "it" before.
you gotta problem with this?
i'm sorry but i cant give you advice since i don't live there.
if those "friends" are unsaved, you are a sinner.
go to the movies or sight seeing or something like that.
we meet a lot and feel the same.
tell her you want to share it with her.
if i found i wanted it, i'd want it over and over again.
if he did it once, don't be fooled into thinking he won't try it again.
you need to dump her like the load of garbage she is.
i like him a lot and miss him when he's not around.
what is wrong with enjoying yourself?
i sure hope not, i already have a lot of issues with gays going after me.
my friends said she loves me.
there must be reason why she eats like that.
does this sound familiar to you at all?
they just want somebody to love them.
i want her to like me.
my racist family hated the fact we were a mixed-race couple. my dad and great grandpa were mad.
i meant to say beauty is only skin deep.
because the color red is the color of blood but most people consider blue to be the color of love.
do you really want him back in your life?
you just use the restroom from there, and did not even wipe yourself?!
you would do best to leave him and strike out on your own.
that sucked. not ever gonna have the tv on when we're getting it on.
youll def be a awesome sister
one day he just began to flirt w/ me
men are gonna be pissed your into him and not them
why make some big deal of it, it's totally normal
listen, you gotta tell him in person!!
i didn’t even get off, the headboard thing messed up the mood.
i love my wife sooooo much!!!
ask him to hang out if they do.
iam _num_ years old and i waited until marriage to have sex.
do they hold the opinion that he lacks confidence?
he does not want to use a condom.
do you imagine she'll be aware of your affection independent of your revelation to her?
i cannot because i am starting to fall in love.
girls like it when you are odd.
someone you love will always be there whether you are happy or sad.
then you can certainly do these things together!
it's ez, just say no!
did you give it your best effort?
a man can work form sun up to sun down, but a womans job is never done.
that description sounds surprisingly similar to flirtation.
the female you are partial towards will be alone, and she states that that is less than desirable.
i like him but i do not love him.
it doesn't matter if you're doing everything accurately.
you never know if you two are good for each other unless you try.
let him know what you want!
you startin to hate the friends of you boo.
want to know how i got over thiss?
put yourself out there, its' worth it.
this dude was stalking me.
i think that sex is supposed to be about giving unselfishly rather than getting something for oneself.
inform her that were she to feel romantically towards you, she would visit and engage in wild sexual intercourse and ingest your ejaculate.
it is like suicide, it is normal to think about it, but not to act upon those thoughts.
my male friends say confidence is key.
if he truly cared about you, the little things would matter to him.
hes just on my mind all the time
that knot websire has loads of ideas
ur married! whats the deal?
he'll ask you to marry him know it
i want a man's whose comfortable in his own skin
you can do whatever floats your boat
the ones you don't expect are the ones that come from the heart
i you die for her 'cause if she died i wouldn't wanta live anymore
if he does not do what you want, discipline him.
i know that he also would not want me to do it.
don't tell him that you want to have intercourse.
be concerned when he sees someone else.
i do not know about love.
i am humbly (and laughingly) stating that i have all the qualities you have mentioned.
i would not necessarily break off a friendship simply because we have a disagreement.
in yahoo! chat, i communicate quite a bit in that forum.
guys that want _num_ thng from you are a dime a dozen, you'll gt used to it.
hold out for a math genious, there's nothing they don't know about curves.
get that thing snipped!
one day you wake up and you've got it all figured out.
no kidding... i'm married an figured that out long ago.
you need to take precautions before you get preggo
break up with him if he is trying to control you
i dont like the bad boy type but i dont know how you feel
they will accept your flaws if they love you
love is love god doesnt care
thats not fair to the guy your dating.
i hate that type, you can't buy class, style or grace,
depends on the size of the dick.
i tried to talk to him but he wont call me back.
my guy works out and his butt is fantastic!
maybe you shouldn’t doubt him?
he’s got no reason to feed you, grow up!!!
if you want to be with him then do it.
just ask him how he feels, it’s bettwr to get it over with!
if you're in bangalore, i am here.
i'm always happing....waking up this morning, and at work now.
you need to ask yourself if you have feelings for him!
stop trying that if she isn't willing.
but, i;ve learned that a dude will show it if he likes you likes you.
when you feel differently you won't talk to her
my guy friends are like my bros. no tension btw us at all.
what were u up to in that class??
i'd ask her if she's into u or not
that's really damn rude of her to do in frant of you.
i am seem to be attracted to shitheads. why am i so effed in the head?
give your prayers to jehova god and jesus christ as your final choice!
take her on a date, maybe take her shopping or something.
i promise that every girl who thinks she is a sex addict has no actual clue about it.
it's gonna cost you _num_ points for every answer.
i think that's not true and that you are just sex addicts.
let him be because he got what he wants and might not want to talk anymore.
i could please use some advice from other people.
your chile wants you to be present, and sending money is not preferrable to that.
don't simply stand around waiting for a good thing.
i need advice, my wife and i cannot conceive.
it depends on the mood of my wife is in at the time.
two failed relationships...first one was love and first site and then died, second one is slowly going down the tubes.
send me an email and i'll spill the beans.
you know the answer.... his heart belongs to someone else.
show some confidence, it's a sexy trait!
he's either crazy or just ins't thinkin strait.
keep away until this calms them down.
guys don't cheat if they're happy with their sex life.
take it slow and her body should do all the talking
chocolate and attention r all girls want
i hate words like that!!!!
it just depends on ur age
love others and they will love you.
you made a mistake, he decided to ask you out
he need to know that you have to respect each other equally.
if you put in, you will get out.
you ever commit a crime, like a felony.
the amount of success you get in life and finding love is the reason for success.
pretend to be a woman looking for a job with the nsa and send him an im
your partner gets hurt when you go out and have fun without him or her
i want my exbf back
wow, that must have sucked
some guys really don't like people touching their asses.
love can be confusing to people until they actually fall in love.
how long into the first date until that happened?
not all dudes only care about sex.
they are probably acting out for a reason.
my butt is not chicken like thank you
im a woman only think about having sex w/man if im in love
maybe he likes u if he has friends
i want it back if you find it please let me know
he's a creep and he's going to cheat on you like he did your cousin
its inconsiderate not to return the favor
please let me know if you see him
what is a relationship if you cannot discuss such subjects?
i don't believe it's a sin, although it terminates in fornication.
but have fun if you decide to do it.
compared to most guys you are obsessed with virginity.
and love for _num_ years with my boyfriend and now it's over.
that opened my eyes to a few things
how do you feel about marriage?
can i get custody even if he's been taking care of the kid?
i believe you have a boyfriend.
it can work for you too.!:)
they are no longer best friends.
we never got together, though, because he regarded me as his best friend.
he even basically adopted my baby daughter as his own!
chill on all the money spending.
find out what you dont want to do
get involved in her stuff even if its not your thing it gives you a change to get to know her
that sounds weird, is she hiding something?
it all depends on the mood that you are in, there are so many factors.
most men are in constant need of intercourse.
are you able to handle a serious relationship?
let her be in the front to observe her reaction
did you read what you wrote ?
you're the best at it.
if you keep flirting and caring about him you will get to know him much better.
it's my choice in the end
no matter how long it takes to stop caring about them.
i can loan you a few dollars.
should i discontinue our relationshp or continue it in the hope she indeed loves me?
to surprise her, tell her in the middle of a conversation.
it seems to me that love does not die so quickly.
i don’t think he likes me the way i am liking him.
i want it more then men do.
come walk a mile in my shoes.
what in tarnation can i do?!?
females want everythang from males.
if you want to listen to more, send me an email.
i agree, but i don't feel that it is a poor decision.
she can see how happy you are because she has realized what she has thrown away.
just one, the first and last.
it's hard to be friends after you've been more than friends.
we're friendly but not enough to kiss.
if it doesn't fit and brings pain, it's too long.
men, you cant train em to drop the toilet seat or change thier minds once made up.
he wants you to do this becuz it gives him permission in his mind that is to cheat.
i'd be worried he's cheating on you, just saying.
i try to be fair but no. dont call me a weak person.
she wants to show ya she doesnt want anyone but you.
he's a guy, thats what they do
i offered him a second chance, but he passed
he will become envious. tell him you hate that as well.
could be that becoming fixated after sex scares men away
sweetie, if you don't want to have sex with a man, that's fine.
you got yours, does it matter?
it's hard to erase those memories
i'm shaba, i want to be friends with somebody from amsterdam.
girls like strong men, not wimps.
you need to be safe about it.
some guys just aren't the same.
if you are being yourself and they do not like you, they do not deserve you.
if they make you happy, you fine with no flirting.
it is simple:; purchase a flower for him and tell him that you love him.
do you still love him?
keep your main boyfriend, and then go and find you a side lover!
ur mom made you move out, so she can't tell you what to do anymore
it's the only thang that serious girls take seriously
i'm assuming u've tried to talk to him?
since he just wants to be friends, u should just move on
don't let other tric u
y r u being mean if they r being nice
get rid of him if he continues to keep harassing you.
hugging him was not the best thing to do at the time. it was not the best solution.
as of yet, i have not met mr. right who is the right person for me.
i am very mature person, so don't fool with me!
why are they keeping it from you?!?
there's a wolf and a lab
send him a note from vacation
you're going to find someone else and wonder why you ever cared about him
if you want to meet a women try the library or walmart
yup its do-able, 'cause i do it all the time
lets be real, you want him to propose
a girl whose checking you out is testing you
thaks for helping w/ wedding plans
the more you give, the more he's gonna grab
you will not be disappointed if you try it sometime.
you really should find a younger guy to date.
no, i would prefer the woman who rejected me die suddenly. i will not care about her at all anymore.
the ego is very conflicting.
i think it probably depends mostly on you and circumstances my friend.
girl, make your own decision up.
the secret admirer clues sure do look like they point to you!
i don't think he will ask you out if you already dumped him, unless he is completely desperate!
oh no plz tell me you are not pregnant?!?
go out with him, ask him!!!!!
yeah if shes drinkin just dont meet her
my lady wz a dude wtf
be nice & friendsly not all up in their biz
wait hey u r on a cd, yeah? u famous!
life is people hurting each other.
they need to be feeling the loving and ready to share!
tell him the truth. he probably won't give a crap.
we've been chatting almost a half a year.
i hope ya find soem new buds.
i saw that too when i was out there.
well the reasons cuz guys and girls are different hormonally
im into girls with a cute butt and small chest
i don't think i can not be a jealous girlfriend
if its been that long just say no
they don't have minds of their own its not your fault
is the kids dad involves.
why he locked up
you should state that you have enough friends.
you will not meet anyone who wants to have a serious relationship unless you have a big penis.
they must accept it.
my friend hasn't the slightest idea, that she has ruined my life.
syou have to move on with your life and find someone new.
i don't see any reason why guys can't have girls as friends.
he will be so happy!!! omg!!
can you see that? wow, i could stare at that all day!
not going to give u a pity lay
do most people just have sex w/bf then?
has nothin to do w.you thou
u make the _num_ move
who knows? it's all up to u!
nope unless they said they're back on...
she's not into you, or you may have came on too strong
nope not weird at all
u can't stop thinking about someone u love
you're _num_, you need someone who's the same.
when people get hitched, they end up acting dumb and mean.
my guess is he's screwing around with somebody else.
the way things are will make things one way or another.
could we go on a date if i wasn't a girl?
it benefits all kinds of people, not just lovers.
i wonder if i'd ever put myself in harms way for someone else?
i am curious as to what this was all about.
you attempt to maneuver its direction at a measured pace. no man enjoys learning of his own sub-par kissing skill.
it cannot be done. if they care about you, then it will hurt no matter how you phrase it,
ewe want to get to know eachother better.
he is about _num_-_num_ years old, and he has a crush on me.
yeah, it’s gonna be hard but just act like you don’t care.
just so she knows-tell her you love her
what do you look for when a man is flirting with you?
ask her and see if she tells you the truth
flirt first and then say you love em
move on dude all u got is time
he was all looking for the razor and then screamed bloody murder
likely she wouldn't havve left you if you were less erratic in the past
kick him to the curb, you are wasting your life staying with him
we couldn't think of a better thing to do
my sister got knocked up by him but is still pregnant with his seed
you gotta get her something meaningful
she doesn't want to get ahold of you anymore.
ok ladies: do you ever use those cosmetic samples at the mall?
these young ladies still have hope.
do not say that because most men are not of low intelligence.
tyes, i will not be in a relationship with a large man.
i know that he is jim.
sentence: it is when she infrequently has sex with you.
don't have intercourse with him for a little bit, it will drive him crazy.
man just stared off in another directon.
mr. is crushin on me.
i get hangry twice daily.
she don't know you need help until you ask.
it's in spots where poc hang.
by the way, there are plenty of commercials that will tell you condoms are not adequate protection, but something is better than nothing!
can you please look into it for me?
she might be able to pretend with other things, but that is one thing she can not fake.
but it really depends on the woman and her confidence in her natural beauty.
however, exclusively on occasions when they're sexually inclined or if you add spice to the occasion.
best you can do to get back at him, ignore him and move on
just be a lyaoal & friendy & nice & sweet person
no matter how pissed she gets, dont chnage it
doesnt always matter the way u use it
we do our best to make women feel comrofortable
by the way, his penis is tiny
what kind of girlfriend is she really, and what are you doing to help fix the trust issue?
especially if you are used to having lots of sex.
they think one way about everything.
unless he is gay, go ahead and tell him.
have i told you lately that you're ridiculously hot?
this is a silly question, you shouldn't ask questions like that.
they aren't as mature as we are.
not love, but really, who truly knows?
he isn't a crack-head or anything like that.
any man that shuns responsibility is a jellybacked coward.
hell and heaven are all around you. all you need to do is just observe.
i don't fully understand all of what you said, but i definitlely know it is spot on.
i had the pleasure of reading what you received, but thank you for the information.
have fun or stay busy.
only if you feel like you are in need of a boyfriend.
men are hunters, just like dogs. they enjoy the hunt but prefer the chase. so run.
what can i do to find out if my boyfriend is in love with me?
this ? makes peeps know u single
shy or scared either one thats me
be careful thats a dangerous path
gonna stop you from doin fun things w/people
yup you got it im drawn to the bad boy
don't get yourself tied down, just go out and have a blast.
if you undress in front of him you'll know right away.
if you have any recommendations for me that would be great.
i'd love a chance to get to know her better.
if she really loves him she will wait for him.
i asked her to be my chick but she didn't answer
what is on the inside is really all that matters.
do you think women give head once they are married?
it is all up to you.
find better men to date, i expect her to do that too.
let him be if you are not content to be just friends.
it will grow as long as you keep working at it.
if it makes you happy, do it.
good looking guys have an attitude mostly
i broke up with my gf and now i need help please? cause i am finding all the trolls.
my dads also just like that!
men call me pretty but idk
she knew i was there and that im into her
she truly thinks your great and loves being friends but wants nothin' beyond that
i don't believe in crushes
imo it's all about the maturity of the kid
does love even meen anything still?
i may not have even wanted it , unless its true.
no one can act like the perfect guy, even tho they want _num_
only if shes twice as old as u.
whos more important to u.
give her some advice so she can move on..even tho she cant.
he ask you on a date i hope.
ain't no way to get that info.
dating will be hard for you is what it means
he as ignorant as me.
don't even go there.
you should find out if he'll marry you and then worry about having kids.
depends on whether you're a girl like me or not.
trust her, that my advise.
you treated like shit, it ain't worth it
it's fulfilling, not boring.
i'm _num_ and good lookin.
_num_ understands the real problems until they're married and have kids.
why do some gals have hair on their faces?
no, they can't because they're hot for each other deep down inside.
he likes to flirt because he's hott.
where do i go to if i need help.
he'll get a girl that loves and cares for him.
if he says no, he won't help.
feel better, because things will be.
talk to your mom, 'cause you ain't mature.
be quiet and don't hurt his feelings
they can't want it as much as i do
my girl likes to get done in the butt.
maybe he wasn't the one
if he cheats then he aint a real man
he said i'm a caveman and she asked what it was
go for it if you love him so much
yeah, don't be doing valentines day
sometimes smart people dumb
_num_ day they will get it.
it ain't the best point in your life, just chill and do it.
u think they aint gonna cheat.
cryings okay, but talkin' works better.
it means the person you're talking bout loves u and wants u back.
i like hangin wit kids...even though im grown
you're the one causing all of this fuss with him
it's only gonna be right once you find the perfect partner for you
you gotta just trust that what he say is true
tell him how you feel
it doesn't matter, male or femail, if they can't be honest, then forget about it!
he still acts like that sometimes.
so, have you cheated on her?
if you like her, compliment her on her hair, outfit, shoes, whatever!
if a guy did that to me, i'd be out!
naturally, it depends upon the guy.
you just answered the question you asked.
if you think so, odds are that he is.
to whow your appreciation, let them know that you care.
you'd be in the poor house in _num_ months.
its not worth staying with someone who isn't right for you...
maybe cuz you're doing it wrong!
throw out everything that is related to him
this is espeically important if you're going to get married and have children.
ladies love jewelry if you have the money for it
you'll never know if you don't ask. worst case she says no...
someone will ask you out
naw you suck at spelling
you need to find proof that she cheated and leave her.
it's chill that you're down for this girl.
you never know what going to happen, that's why love is so nuts.
we both know that we go to the same school.
you might not think she hot, but she doesn't care.
if you can't say it to him directly, try practicing in a mirror when he's gone
neither of you is a virgin, right?
that's cuz they're thinking with something other than their head
i got really tight with this guy
it's a mystery, but most of the time women are a mystery to men
you just hot for him
didn't work for me
won't be breakin no laws cuz u'll be kidnapping her not dating her
depends what she says is she's the one
i think it is good to try a sample of something before you get the whole thing.
it was an event that occurred without your knowledge.
if my sister's friend was rude to me, i would immediately leave the room.
don't buy a woman lingerie unless she asks for it.
how to check that i love her a lot.
before you look away smile otherwise she;; think u think shes not fine
sersly if he only likes her a little why so upset
sure she really loves u?
it’s your decision but you need to stop giving in and having sex when you don’t want to
first of all-you can’t trust her cuz she’s not acting like a good it’s your decisionfriend.
it’s because you’re different than everybody else
look for somebody who’s on the same level as you
understand what you’re going through because i’m in the same boat.
yeah i am not interested in them.
what should we do when we see her upset?
take all the time you need to really figure out what you want.
he just completely ignores me as always.
go out and have a good time with your friends.
i recommend asking 'what if we were married one day.'
i recommend going to the gym to practice speaking in a lower voice, and always be confident.
try expressing how you feel with a card.
all men love to be in competitions.
sleep aways brings lots of thoughts.
tell him about the other guy that made you upset when he tried something.
god does a lot.
don't have sex with him and wait for him to text... hope this helped.
look in his eyes then ull know
why even ask me of course ur #_num_
he needs firsthand experience

if you're a woman contact me at shrunkenmann_thegrass@yahoo.com

i feel strongly in my decision to quit the school team.
tell you bf, tell him you don't like that guy, and tell him why!

she would leave if she did not love you, correct?
however, i truly love this girl.
i hate to say so, but it will become worse after you get married.
i am a man with traditional values.
it depends on your relationship.
and, without a doubt, visit and offer salutations!

the group doesn't understand even though we are sending explanations
try new things in a different direction when one fails
i like indepdent women

you're looking on yahoo answers
i am telling you from personal experience.
it's feelings and emosions that count
easier said than done, i know

if he gets to possessive tell him to hit the road
get those things reduced less pain
be you and like the guy said earn money could help
im _num_ and just got a gf
it is how life works.
i would advise you to wait until she is ready to wear a brassiere.
are you asking him if he still finds you attractive?
he will be pleasantly surprised and love you even more for it.
what's the reason for not simply sending an email to him with your inquiry?
give her some space and tell her you love her.
you are a sneaky guy. i was just gonna ask the same thing.

i'm sorry i dont know what to say if it's agianst your religion.
who's your mom with?
i'm into brunettes with dark eyes, nice skin and of course a nice ass!
yeah, good luck with that.
do not ask how you can get girls to like you.
i don't focus on men's bottoms usually.
he genuinely has a massive partiality towards you.
i recently acquired a labrador and i truly enjoy him.
it is, however, very difficult to avoid.
sex is totally different and much closer feeling when youre actually in love
imaginging something is the only way to get something
everyone just wants to come to the u.s. like everyone, but that's just how i see it. see ya.

ask if he'd have a problem wih you sending pics like that.
that's my first and last time watching porn while having sex.

so what you mean is you have a new little baby sister!
if i see you with another girl, i might flip out!
if you like to play sports, try volleyball, basketball, or something like that.
if u cant take care of a baby dont have sex
men are tough more than strong

for myself, i'd say yes.
if you're like _num_ years old, then no.

i think he mighta found another way to pleasure himself
dont think about buying something expensive
freek in the mind but not a slut
hey, easy on the wallet.
as a male, i know that lots of guys are just in it for themselves
why don't you just let unimportant stuff build up?
it all depends on how bad she looks.
i dont think so unless you're trying to kill yourself.
only if u really love it otherwise say no
when she dreams its abut him
soap up if ur smelly
how i see it
say want to have a soda?
i feel i do not have a chance because another girl likes the same guy as me.

you are acting like a stalker, stop texting her, you jsut met her

i'll only get upset if some weirdo is watching!
if you're happy and moving forward you must as well end the relationship.
are you a schizo, or have another mental illness?
we make the uncomfortable so they act stupid.
we only fucked _num_ times a week.
i would love if she masturbated in front of me.
believe whatever the hell you want.
why waste your time on an individual that would disrespect you.
most men try to act ignorant around the women they are attracted to.
inquire of him directly, whether he wishes to become your spouse.
it would look interesting, but it is fine as long as you love each other.
it will eventually be worth the trouble.
what do you mean?
or me male ego cannot deal with a woman knowing about it.
he abused me mentally and physically.
it means that he really cherishes you.
he is the one who isn't in love with you.
i there any chance that they like each other?
most men are not truly unintelligent; you are simply meeting the wrong people.
the wedding is simply not about you.
we'll have phone sex on the daily and never get tired of it.
do something that most other people can't say that they've done.
he doesn't brag about him to her friends like she used to.
since you are single, you should have fun while you can.
you should not fuck your cousin.
gotta let the dudes knw what you want
all depends on te time u have been at it
won't find one here
boys want to be all grown ass dudes and grown ass dudes want grown ass ladys

there’s a super cute guy that lives down the street.
it’s easy either he loves u or not.
please email me if you have the answer.
if you like him, then it is not bad.
you may have already made her uncomfortable.
women can also have them.
marry her at the courthouse.
see what excites you more.
find me if you would like to have a lot of fun.
you are just another booty call.
i am outside of your window.
the frist kiss sent my head spinning.
some men do and others do not.
i think that 'no answer' is your response and you simply do not want to acknowledge it.
women want to dick around while men want to get right to it.
come on he deserves oral sex every once in a while.
maybe he just wants to know that your okay
i don't think that he will lie if you ask him straight up
i fucking hate valentines day!
just saying get rid of that stinky cat , flea bomb and deep clean the whole house and furntiure especially the bed!
if he care then he wouldnt of looked at that girl twice.
dump him, its so obvious he dont care.
let everyone know how you feel just put it out there!
can w e put an ad or notice in the newspaper ?
i was just curious because you're always ready to get it on.
it's a little porno too.
sorry but its gross.
yo bro, you need to live in the miami area so head this way.
if you think she's hot, try to date her.
i do not. although, homer simpson is attractive.
tell him that he is an attractive vampire.
i do not believe in astrology.
when you find your diamond in the ruff, hopefully he will want you for you.
the one i went to had a belly dancer and i found it lame.
you can't be in charge of what they dream.
maybe what they say it is just a fantasy
does he like adult toys?
rub yourselfs with whipped cream and other stuff to have fun.
break a leg!!! you will beat him.
dont let her mess with your mind.
your sad so let them know.
some folks can live with it and some can't.
it could be a friend, a spouse, or even a family member.
it can work if you want it to.
are you serious about your age because i am twenty-five.
it's just way too odd!
she's cunning & just wants someone to control.
putt putt golf, laser tag, or go-karts could entertain older children
you can tell him you have a std if that doesn't work
run if she doesn't stop after you tell her it's disturbing to you
women from the philippines met their person on line, got hitched and came here.
tell me why don't you just ask him out?
if not being together maes em happy then be happy for them as well.
wyhen he knows i am not paying attention, he will stare at a woman.
he's no longer seeing me.
you have a significant history with him, so you know his true character.
you are living in a fantasy, not reality.
me and my bf went to dinner
he doesn't like your kids and you don't like his?
a chess cake would be cooler
that will show her she is important compared to your friends.
if it is about love and you can then it is probably good.
there are alot of other guys.
why can she not see because we all can.
we have flirted a lot, but i am still unsure.
just sit w/them and say u want _num_ understood and supported
get so many sex ?s
do it now ween him off it then he gets used to it
as long as you have protection you're good to go
just be straight up and honest
i'd work with him again
i married my high school girlfriends sister
pregnant ladies lose interest like that.
do you own a nice cast iron skillet?
you have to ask him questions directly, if he plans on staying in your life until death do us part.
ihave been on dates, though not as many as i could have if i had pretended to be unintelligent.
he says that he respects and understand my desire to wait.
what should i say?
don't let it affect you so severely.
life is like a roller coaster; you need to adapt to it.
forget him if he is joking about liking you.
it is as people say: there is someone for everyone.
he did not love you and do you know how i know that ?
to spice up things you may want to try to watch porn together
what options does a girl have ?
continue with your life after you get out of the relationship.
if you want to keep your friendship trust me you do not want to date your friends younger sister.
if he really loves you then he wont care how much money you have.
you need to get the cops on him if he wont pay for his kids!!!
let keep this between us ok.
would you ask a guy that ?
talk enough so you can see if shes into you.
you could be bi if your attracted to guys
she's still pretty broken up over you because of the first time
how should i let him know?
what am i supposed to do in this situation?!
if she likes ur butt you can definitely depend on her to do it
i'm not trying to argue, she gets jealous with a quickness.
it will be the best feeling ever!
she needs to open her eyes, before something horrible happens!
you can tell how a person feels about you by the way they look at you and talk to you
it started quiet, then built up, then boom!
i've learned lots of new information, that i wasn't aware of before.
simply inform her of your feelings and the reason you feel lovingly towards her.
the one that i had with your mother.!!
ook, ask me one question at a time, you are confusing me.
i am certain about what men want
see what she says and then you'll know
its so good i invested in a food busines there
i dont know what to try and spice things up with
every once in awhile i need a change
go on some dates find someone new forget him
get over him or wait. your choice
think about it, but my advice is to dump him and move on
we can talk about it if you want.
sure, if you are a boy.
someone finally aske me out!! i was starting to think that would never happen
if you have to ask the ? then you are too young to get hitched
when i was married i never considered cheating.
she won't ever admit it.
leave the m alone already.
just laugh, you will feel better.
you should make sure you want to communicate.
you need to tell your partner and attempt to understand him. help youself by helping each other.
hopefully one they they will see the truth.
talk it out before you make the wrong decision.
tell him the right way which is in a tender way.
ask him out to dinner or maybe a movie.
well it worked for me when i got her drunk and kissed her.
people come and go so you should pray for guidance.
you hung out with the 'rents?
no, only if sick
i would not want him to.
thinking about what kind of man is he nice and decent
sometimes a friend should know when someone needs to be alone
when talking to women you have to be yourself and let your personality come out if not she'll since that you lying and you'll lose it
singing this is the easy part doing it is the hard part.
don't do anything karma will take care of her
i use to like him but i'm afraid to ask him if he still likes me.
people can't have everything they want.
contact me if you need help.
do we want to believe that our moms are liars?
females arn't bad liars.
did you ask him what made him cheat?
should i tell her in person or just on the phone?
when you have kids it changes everything.
being far apart makes it harder to lie.
light a few candles, dim the lights and stay on top of the covers.
he broke up with me in less than a week!!!!!
when you be caring about it all the way, thats love
you gotta get grown first
you can have it both ways and not lose a thing!!
you know he be cheating if he say no!!
use pam to take care of it
na, are you a guy or girl
would do it, it costs nothing
don't date anyone new if you still want thee ex
me and the bubs moved in _num_ weeks ago do it
same reason i said
delicately some dudes just need a little extra to get it done
keep going if u like him
what the heck s goin on in dudes heads
he knows that we don't know each other well.
if he doesn't admit to it then don't let it happen if you don't want it.
a lot of dudes think with their other head and not the one above of their necks.
girls like his personality.
when you dig a dude that likes ya.
trust me even though its a lot.
this guy needs to help with your costs too.
when he's drunk, take your clothes off.
it's fun to have sex with somebody you're in love with.
yeah i don't think i could date a stripper.
i like them small. boobs that is.
so john asked me if i'd be jealous if he going out with this alyssa girl
what do you enjoy doing?
my thoughts and attention span on this disappeared, and i suspect other men's thoughts and attention did too.
if you can make them laugh, they will love you.
one said, 'i cannot leave my kids.' the other asked, 'why did you ask me to have coffee with you?'
my guess is between _num_ and _num_
if she doesn't like it, move on, your young, plenty more girls out there!
well, what did you expect?
try it, you never know you might enjoy just spending time with someone, instead of being a horn dog.
after the hubby and i got married (_num_) we honeymooned it hawaii for _num_ whole weeks!
i need to get out of this. how?
i don't think you should worry about it.
being in love is to never get bored.
you would have way more money if you found a job you know.
if you are both happy then do what comes naturally !!!
i want some love songs to listen to, i know it sounds girly but dont judge me!!!
if you don't have sex with him then they wont think your a slut.
what if you are into her and dont know if she's into you????
once they know they have u the chase is done and its not fun
yeah well doesnt mean he doesnt care bout u
theres no way he noticed that!
most of those idiots are horny but not getting any
i wanna be ur friend but how old are u?
well its up to u but dont take too much time looking
don't push. let him open up when he wants to
you're putting a lot out there with that outfit.
the money is good, but there's more too it than it seems.
if you don't hurry, the other person may get them.
you can learn from this.
should i break up with him or not?
your age difference is rather drastic, so you should be careful.
i laughed very hard when i read it.
go to a party, and strike a conversation with the party goers.
they think cause they hot that they can date _num_
tell him worse can happen is no
just that he is kind and respects me
hes not worth ur time!!!!
there is a gentleman that my friend likes who claims he wants to know her better
chicks will never know the answer to that.
its a good idea since chicks are more mature for their age.
do you have serious feelings for someone?
i will child was running across the street in the rain jaywalking and i stopped it
if you give him everything he wants that he'll have all the control of the
it's weird that says you're only young person is here answering questions
if you want tohave sex you can
never let me walk all over you
did he volunteer the information or did you catch him?
is it really wise to marry a man accused of two attempted murders?
you must accept the truth, even though it is sad.
if she is shy, then she is most likely very interested in you.
unless it is one sided love, i would do anything to the extent of giving my soul away.
make him do a good test to see if he is lying.
my day sucks, too.
he still sees missed calls even if the volume isn't on.
ask her to dinner.
well to tell you the truth they are just bad stuff
if you can't do the real thing, there's always phone sex.
when you talk to her, just decide where u r gonna live
nah, that wont be useful at all
she loves to dye her hair different colors
this is your time and your life.
i do not know.
have a nice day.
do it for your man.
won't work if it won't fit in the mouth.
we'll have to see, tell me your age and your mom's age.
any ideas on how i should break it to them?
some people are just high on the ignorance scale.
what else matters to him?
you shouldn't do that to your friend, it's mean.
excellent appearance, refined tendencies, and, without a doubt, an excellent physique constitutes a desirable female companion.
it will be painful either way.
they have never had anyone treat them that way, so they are apathetic.
what do you mean because it seems like you know nothing about women.
can i go to your website or something?
just tell her you want to kiss her.
does it hurt when you do it?
stay far away from heroin.
even if you love him you got to let him go.
some guys have hot butts.
there are pretty girls wherever i look.
_num_ and jj go to school with me.
folks come up with a lotta reasons for why they ain't found their s.o. yet.
seemks like he's gotta grow up still.
you oughta get her to give a sports bra a shot.
i have been more than cool with everyv step of the way ... what can i do besides that?
you guys split up, so he can deal with it.
this is how ya wanna find whatcha now no u needed too knew
yep, aint no way no how, nupe!
stars! that one muslin guys was shur are laffn lots on them ansers i gess the kwestyuns was funny!

heck, ever one thinks i aint so smart well looka here thay ottr be a thinkn n wundrn who that be a judjn
are you sure it's love or are they just saying that
love me a beast with a great jaw line
he's ignoring you! just like we do
should i move on from this crush?
she accepted my accidental proposal
its not the only thing that is a fact
different things about a woman are liked by men
simply inform her that you occasionally require a hug.
avoid simply transferring it from yourself to her.
perhaps, you two should separate for a short period of time.
school is fun around the time you are in sixth grade.
usually, you love your partner more when you're sexually intimate.
men merely want sincere and caring women who can accommodate them in life. that is it.
his brother introduced us.
i would advise you to not hold back.
i suppose it requires a lot of patience.
it isn't necessary, but it is incredibly helpful.
my answer was, yes, very much so.
from the sound of it, he already has a girlfriend.
whether or not you are wearing a skirt and heeled shoes or loose jeans.
he clearly is attempting to engage a different female, therefore, i would withdraw.
break it off but be cool about it.
ya, right, like i'd ever pack my husbands bag... as if!
get over it! get on with your friggin life!
don't be stupid like i was.
i get it, i have that problem too.
i was disgusted when my chick bit off my tip and ate it.
i' have issues with my boyfriend taking another chick out to lunch on v-day
being overweight accounts for the second highest killer in the nation when it comes to the younger generation.
if you find her it will happen once again.
if i just knew what the correct response was...
visit some resort that's meaningful to her
and she wants nobody talking about anything that's going on.
go to yahoo messenger and look for pao__num_ and send me an im
like i was two years back...
he said he doesn't love you cause you only called twice?
i think tons of things are really important.
make her happy with sex too.
i know lots of nice guys.
if you keeping looking for you're prince you'll find him
even though its ok to do it, you don't need to tell your partner you're thinging about it!
you need to get that shy is a downer, and people find you more exciting if you ain't
i did this like every day for a while
just throw it out, casual-like
they are very untruthful.
being intimate with a friend, cab create a rift in the relationship.
find a woman who has similar interests as you.
if you truly care for this person then you ought to try it.
just curious as to whether any women have advice about having sexual relations for the first time?
no but if ur friend wants to watch ok
tough being _num_ isn't it?
bigger bed or marriage counselor is what u need
gotta have sex like agua and air
you gotta feel me it will suck
they been together like _num_
yeah those friends will talk behind ur back
state and federal grants you dont have to pay back
you don’t need special shoes.
if he can’t sit with you then your just friends.
if he can’t lick it, he can’t stick it!!
who broke it off?
i would say adam and eve, but they were smart.
i am taken aback by the size of your ego.
it is easy to make a cake.
no. enter reality, this is not a place to communicate freely.
why can't you just do this one thing?
if he loves her, then why not be in a relationship with her?
tell him he is the boss, or leave him to find someone else.
get to a doctor if you have not already.
whether my friends agree with this or not, i believe as a friend, i am irreplaceable.
catch him or her off guard by telling them that you love em.
he always appoligizes but he keeps on doing the same things over and over.
my guy is like a government mule, always farting and bleching, lol.
if he only likes you for what you do then trying doing stuff that he dont like and see how he acts.
you will never know if you don't tell him the truth.
it's just destined to be.
god loves you first and then love them
you should think long and hard.
when i fell to my knees i shall never forget that strange moment
will u play this for me-babybaby stay gone by jimmy wayne
making out is my thing love it
dont do anything unless u want _num_
had a hot hubs but he was rude as hell, divorced him
if u both can wait, totally worth it
leave him alone or u will get into trouble
love isn't scary at all. if you're scared, you aren't in love. the right guy will come along. good luck.
you can date immediately if you want.
your mom threw out he wrong person
you want a special night? don't get edible panties.
it's not for you.
women don't like to be pressured so don't try to force them.
yeah but i don't want to.
we sat on my bed together and i looked into her eyes as i went in for a kiss.
just see what happens. the timing may not be right for you to find the "one".
you can either choose to get along or not to.
i look good and love porn and oral sex not prude
normally when it rains the waves dont get that big
u dont want to talk to him anymore
it's not really like that, but getting pregnant could lead to defects.
if you just tell her upfront, you won't be hiding it and it will save fights down the road.
don't date her again.
if women don't think you're hot it's because of their issues, not yours.
i have no idea what to do with them both.
sounds like his boss was always putting him down.
look him straight in the eys and the truth will come out.
men like younger women, it's a running theme with us.
if he can't get over this without killing himself, that's totally up to him.
he tried to off himself and like a dope, i showed up at the hospital to offer my support.
p.s., i didn't mean that as a criticism, i'm not trying to stick a label on ya
don't let sex screw things up
men are ppl too ya know, women aren't the only ones w/feelings
women and men are different, ya know
it has several different meanings.
sure, if you get up off your butt!
a guy is a guy
not all men are but, there are still men that do.
whatever, at least mine do live.
she has to be jealous for a reason!
he doesn't like kids? that's a bad deal
she only did it once.
you're bi if you like both guys and girls!
i love a nice round a** on a guy!
whats the point if u dont want to marry?
im into doggy style imo
if u like her go ahead
give him some love and affection!
i couldn't believe her eyes until i saw them.
i've been with her since i was _num_, _num_ months ago.
if you're horny, have sex.
hope she doesn't care i've been with other girls.
the man didnt do it to u
can't u just talk without soundin like ur accusin someone
my man luvs me...i hope urs does _num_
i live in romania...u should come see me
be married if that is what you want.
you had an intimate interlude with her, she is the boss, and that is just that.
i believe he didn't, because he feels terrible.
he is a jerk, but he says he wants to be with me.
iif you are truly her friend, then, you would not even consider it!
congratulations to the bride and groom, she is a lucky girl!
you are, however, too good for her in any event.
post a sex video about yourself, it pay.
dont matter what she looks like.
i dont think that the chickens really care about that.
when she tried to swipe her cards, she found out they were cancelled.
get her valentine's presents even if valentines is over, esp. if she is a romantic type of girl.
do you have a desire to be criticized as unintelligent?
i want to try something a little more exciting.
if you aren't turned on, sex will be uncomfortable.
no, he only likes to talk to you.
wait and see what happens if you think it will lead to heartbreak
you don't love her cuz you don't know her!!!
been there done that.
how could u rationalize doing somethin like this and telling others?
i hope it all works out, either finding that loved one or someone new.
however, they need not be partially unclothed.
protect yourself from getting pregnant if you are not ready to become a mother.
you should be more careful next time and prevent yourself from being hurt.
just have some fun and do not let it bother you, play the field!
ladies do it too, i think.
it is benefecial to not have sex with a lady if she is hideous.
you'll find one to love
everything is sweeter when your in love.
did she do it to you?
just let her know u love her & find cahs
just tell her take that chance
_num_ my yahoo chat name was oscreamifyoudoitright
what should you do if your boyfriend hasn't called or messaged you in three weeks?
this is how my wife makes me pay attention.
there is something missing from their relationship, because they are not happy.
you are my best friend in the world.
it depends on age
find an inmate they're desperete to get married
i didnt know that until now!
do it once you're married
you're never going to feel like you can trust men
women usually just don't talk about it
you wanna talk about it
when you cant get someone off your mind
don't go back because of him
look in her eyes and smile
it means exactly what she says it means.
really i don’t believe in horoscopes but i’m a gemini
for some guys it’s only about sex
yeah my x said that before
he don’t really love you-he just wanted a make out session
you didn’t tell me whether your wife had children or not
seems like he isn't interested in you
there are better ppl for you out there
youll have more urges to be w other girls than if u were in luv
no way would i ever see him again
maybe find somewhere thats far enough from home but close enough that your family can visit like once a month
when you can hear each other without saying nething.
a chick knows what i want irl, right?
if you love each other you will have sex.
think about getting a job and sending him money.
i can't help thinking if it was me.
what if it don't work?
be yourself, be quaint, and wait!
could be love after _num_ months
i've got a couple, you judge.
do u have a ckn ass?
no comparison needed. men are so goo at this!!
first comes the personality, then the fit body, then the kindness
u can like whoever u like!
admit it, she's not into you
why nut just vex evry man??!?
ok yaar, all is well now.
i think the cat needs a new home.
you sound like a hottie so that is a great way to start.
first of all, find a guy you really dig.
what guy wouldn't want a virgin?
you should give it a ton of thought.
if he is around you'll never have any peace.
he was a mature man, not a little boy.
you clearly acted correctly.
it would be nice to chat with someone
my sig other lives far away
i am a big flirt
mmmm curvey men are where it's at
for valentines day send the ex a gift
when ur on te same hotness level its worth it
you are the only _num_ here
only sex w/my dude and he had _num_ else
tell him you dont want to marry him and he keep trying you then leave!!!
no matter what your little girl comes first in all parts of your life.
there is somebody for everyone.
i made it and you can too.
let your bff say it for you.
do any other females feel the same way?
if it is true love then he will wait for you without cheating on you.
do not take life seriosuly, you are young.
they have a hard face.
be honest and the true love will find you anywhere :)
i can't stop thinking about sex. even more than all my buddies.
(sung super off key) stupid songs are quite something!
keep your head up and smiiiiile
they r max _num_ yrs older than u
approach her and tell her that you are the man for whom she has been waiting all her life.
there are many more out there than what appear to be available at present.
they don't care if they laugh
in did, in my brain
dudes are different and everyone likes different girls
as long as you like him, it is fine.
your retarded and you wouldn't date no one if you were my kid.
i'd help but i'm too lazy to read the qn
the rest is just looks
don't settle, you deserve more
i have this hottie and omg he is getting ensnared in my traps, dude will wanna move in i think.
my ex still has a big piece of my heart.
steer clear of that vegetation.
if she likes you, awesome.
if it's because you're like someone else then just tell me
how is discrimination wrong based off sexual orientation
some people really like it but it creeps me out
if they love you they care how you feel
until then, stop being an ass
she says it doesnt mean shit,and thats every dudes dream
better be respectful about it too
sure ur not sending him the wrong message??
yanno jus sumtime ya jus gotta get to stepp'n, grass greener no worky butt stay'n don neither, in-between place is when ya move your heart to "let it go"
i haven't met a girl yet that thinks the same, y'all agree but the route taken is circuitous
oh bae, did the mighty kingkong dingdong lose his tighty dingaling queenkong?
yeah butt who you are deepens who you are!
sooo...u think it be a worthy try eh?
i not sure...are you?
so who are you into? guys? girls? both? or none of the above :)
the sky's the limit baby! go for it!!
i don't know what to say if she asks me
why arent you working?
i think i freaking love him.
i asked him how he knew i was looking
would he get mad if you ask other men for pictures
it couldn't have been that bad if they got married anyway
i'm trying to tell you that it was long!!
women are not easily sexually aroused, you need heop
you are probably too young and immature to get married if you have to ask.
i always argue with my mother's boyfriend.
i am a self-proclaimed sex-addict. i do not know if something is wrong with me, or if i simply enjoy sex.
their favorite position is your money in their hands.
a girl i know offered to let me stay at her place.
tell them you already have a date and they should have asked you out sooner.
stop daydreaming about what could be.
if you do impress her, she won't think about you the same way.
when i think about it, i'm not sure why i did that.
i am not asking him on a date or anything similar.
it is too much risk if you are asking for my opinion.
if you are truly interested in the answer, just ask her.
what use is a nice appearance if he is rude?
ask him if he would like to go on a date with you.
it's our only problem, we get along fine except that.
where did you get these numbers?
if you don't like them, don't date them. simple
it probably makes him uncomfortable.
i am smart but not up to his level.
have you ever liked a chic but not enough to be in a committed relationship with her?
that would be awful if you broke up after that.
you are completely new to me.
run as fast as you can and don't ever turn around.
i heard people say that if you ask god for forgiveness for being gay you still get into heaven.
i care for him, but just as a friend.
learn how to spell cause i can't understand what your asking
don't do it, you know youre gonna regret it.
he won't tell you but he talks to someone else.
cause of that i started drinking and smoking, too.
if you agree with him, good, but how do you really feel about it?
get a thick one, just like you like it.
she's afraid all the time.
it's true some _num_ year old men are attractive but you should look for someone younger.
opposite of above me?
guys don't really like to do that.
why not just ask her out?
i dont care what they think, she's the one for me forever.
aww hey, you know, pj party? i'll bring da pillows!
is it all fun and games? how can you hurt the people who should care about most?
i'm like that and my friend picks on me for it.
i have live this. move on and youll get over it.
most guys dream about the same thing
it's not a good idea to date so many people
i've got that problem too
karma will come around
don't let him see you when you're down
we're happy and love life!
see him once and if he's cool keep him around
why r the sports w/contact so exicitng!?
omg dont get another dog
should love the one you are having sex with
think its better to loose lover than be w/someone who dont care
think if ur asking u love ur wife!
if you want get a guy's interest, act sincere...ya know, be yerself.
my boobs are too big for this shirt to fit right.
check out my q/a and you'll see that i cheated with my girlfriend's friend and them dropped her like a hot potato.
i don't think he knows i love him, he just looks at me like a friend. :(
men give a high ranking to sex.....and why not, it feels mavalous!
it's right under angelina's nose in the same house.
it's a black guy breaks in my house is it cool to say all black people are criminals?
was i not pretty enough for him that night
wear that sexy outfit he likes make his favorite dish and rock his world
girls dig a guy who doesn't lie.
what he said, that shows what kind of person he is.
he never texted, he just rang, and she was like how do i answer this phone, and it was like weekly if he did contact her.
girls love some lesbian action, but many deny it, espec as they get older.
not possible, cuz i'm not with a girrrl.
chicks... ever dig a dude you didn't know and hang wit him?
heckk yeah!!!!! if you want, give him _num_
quickly accessable if you use it?
men care so much more about it then ladies.
just jazzed about the concept of experiencing love?
give em a toilet brush
quit playing childish games, no reason for it.
that's not a normal thing for a dude.
i'd probably dump him if he pulled that.
i'm not a fan of fake boobs
you're caught in your web of lies
what don't you get? he just wanted to sleep with you
don't waste your time giving him chances
thanks i was just curious
if you two don't want to get together, no problem!!
go wild .... get together in the wild!!!!
i think you'll see it happen; it's easy.
or .... do you love that person known as me?
umm ... you just answered your own ?
i don't think flirting is playing dumb.
you only live once so enjoy it.
i start with talking about what they're wearing.
he totally thought i was having fun.
boys are definitely more sensitive but they aren't allowed to show it like girls are.
dump her and move on with your life.
if you're meant to be together, love will make it happen.
you can't give him another shot at hurting you.
of course you can but do you mean it?
women want to make it challenging and not just have some easily controlled man.
just watch his actions.
once i break up with someone i won't date them again.
it's the holy grail of information.
use condoms and be safe.
it's your choice, you only have to do what you want.
it isn't a negative item.
enjoy your life. do not allow him to slow your progress.
forgive and forget as little as possible.
if a man does not care he would not care.
all men do it, even those who're married.
lately he avoids me, and will not talk to me.
divorce is not an action popular with children.
every day you should try to do one good deed.
begin searching for someone closer to your age with whom you have something in common.
no man has ever said i want to be friends with women.
it depends on you guys
you sound sorry good you should
it matters how thick it is as much as how long
i am in my mid twenties and still haven't had sex.
if its not improtant then why is she seeing another chick?
give him time to know your kids.
if they love each other, they will shack up.
yeah, you can, where were you during sex ed class?
you can't judge a book by it's cover, kiddo. not everything is as it initially seems.
that feel when you need to hug him every time you see him.
that love song just makes you think about them.
do you think that he dosen't trust me?
don't worry about that, ok.
stuff changes when u get older
he'll move on and find someone else, but u lookin for something better, yeah?
stocks and bonds, just try investing in that stuff, you know
seems your just clinging to a dream from what u said. dr. checko--it's a nickname
toss it all out there and deal with the fallout
i believe unintelligent far exceeds foolish.
why does the color of someone's skin matter?
tell her to hold on.
he still doesn't want to be more than friends.
don't make it your circus and your monkeys.
try to make him jealous by pretending your interested in his best friend.
looks like they've become a better friend.
this is not something that should be accomplished through e-mail.
if i get broken up with over it, then i deserve it.
she will need to listen and find out what happens.
it is better to say 'let's stop'.
tell her to reconsider.
nope, you girls are too scared
inform him that it's your way, or you will not hear it.
when i first started dating matt, i was in to john & did not know he felt the same.
same as why guys do it
dress right and nice guys will notice
if we do the deed she will figure it out eventually
that's just not smart at all....you r never gonna get it
sure, you love him, but do you want to risk him bringing a disease home?
i need lots of answers so start talking.
who cares what his rear end looks like if he treats you good.
they don't want to still be your friend?
they r a huge chunk of ur life
some dudes just dont want to be hitched just talk about it
lots of married dudes r happy
simply assure her that her parents lover her very much even though they no longer live together.
tell her you've been there, and he gave you a sexually transmitted infection.
you can start by saying hi, and having a casual conversation.
i inquired as to whether he continued to feel positively towards me and he responded negatively.
you need to do the things that you like doing.
in all likelihood the answer is 'no' because he does not really know her if they me online.
it is abnormal and not normal.
do not force it. you may make a mistake if you do.
if he doesn't like her, then it would be of her best interests to move on.
you will not receive a positive response.
you need someone there for you through it all good or bad.
you could wait to see if she sends you an email or just ask her in person.
those flowers may be too strong.
the two of you should be getting it on all the time
i think you already know.
if you can just wait, youll get positive outcomes
dont get hung up on the past, it's not a thing, if your girl love you.
all _num_ together i'd say is cool, all good with me, but if not, i'd say no
it's typically the person who isn't best in bed.
don't try too hard to impress, just let her know straight up that you dig her.
i got popped when i was _num_, i don't understand what's a big deal is about losing virginity.
do you have convos in yahoo chat rooms?
you should tell him if you dig his buddy instead of him.
i don't dig skinny chics.
why do men in relationships (married or not) cheat?
what is it that men want from women?
why would someone risk everything for sex?
it's a shame how some people act.
some girls think it strange if you wait too long.
are you having trouble with the one you got?
be direct ...are you gonna let me speak my peice, or what?
have a party with all you girlfriends, let her meet some new people.
you are _num_ and he's _num_, not a big difference.
men are simple so just remember _num_ words - food and sex - and u will get your hubby's attention.
if you like brainy women don't bother looking at tall beautiful blondes.
to get a straight answer try asking a question
do u fall in love due to personality or hotness?
take my word for it, u will be sorry later in life.
get over it and talk to him.
the #_num_ reason for divorce... getting married!!!
you know he's lying and you just let him.
you don't know how old he is?
falling in love after _num_ months is totally possible,it happened to me.
say, "this isn't about you, it's about me."
i'm crushin on this chick at my learnin place.
did you think about her when you were snoozin?
get your bff and have a chat jam.
i am not a bro who talks with the other bros.
that's a good way to start your day off
i'd like to have a picnic lunch in a pretty, quiet, private setting.
ask him where he works and how many hours he works.
you know we do that
i have been in this situation.
if in doubt, ask her permission.
i am searching for a woman who is a virgin, as i am one too.
do not say more than you need to.
i guess a personality that isn't great but not terrible
when you get older, you will think differently.
they be addicted to estacy
i hope she don't die.
if you want to follow someone you can.
if you like the man say so and if not, say so.
the world has so may men.
get someone else because you wouldn't have gotten hitched.
you will have to sign another with each other each day.
hey man, come enjoy the party, my hot girlfriend is a great stripper.
don't let the little things get you down.
but if it was just a dream, of course.
being is love always leads to heartbreak.
it doesn't matter if i share their religion to go to the wedding
its not worth the heartache find a guy that will treat you with respect
only one girl needs to like you.
did you think he wanted more because of the flirting?
if she doesn't give u her number, she doesn't want you
its just a girl actin older
dump his ass, he doesn't love you
that aint your business
ya, i have my own ideas on that.
lol is" laughing out loud"
so, should i have sex with my gal?
so, try flirting, see what happens. xoxoxo
don't allow a rival female to have an opportunity with the object of your affection.
just kidding he says, as he throws a banana at the screen and scratches head.
i would persue a intimate relationship with her even if she had just been intimate with him.
behave appropriately and heed your heart's desire!
ask her out on a casual date.
yeah can't get hitched in the slammer
um they are like you so don't be putting them down
i love my sister like crazy, but she keeps picking guys that are jerks.
iraq is like a world away, but stay in touch anyway.
there are ways to get it done, chair, ladder, step stool, stilts...
it's simple, he just likes drifting from chick to chick.
you're the only one for me...always.
peeps don't go there.
anyone done it before they got hitched????
what's the prob with sex????
just go and surprise him already!!!!
yeah that story is like that tv show.
i feel their husbands aren’t good enough
anyway i don’t think it’s anything to worry about
love someone for who they are and not the color of their skin
i left and joined the rec team and i had a lot more fun.
the women with poor hygiene don’t think they stink and that’s the issue
we are not becoming younger, and that is the adventure of life.
i confront him when he looks at another woman, but he denies it.
youare correct but i nevertheless must do it or she will be angry.
just make sure that you do not get involved in their fights.
just in the event you two individuals are the closest of companions.
how should i act so i don't scare her off?
as long as yer _num_+ is shouldn't matter.
hook up with old friends and you'll prolly meet some new ones _num_
when a person is brainwashed, they ain't gonna understand your side of it.
not really somethin that turns me on, kwim?
i'm with you on that one, that's all i know.
uhhh, if you can't figure it out, i'm not telling you!!!
i'm a man, i'm always right.
sex and candy is my favorite song eva!
maybe she feels the same way...
i'mma not of the opinion he doesn't find you trustworthy.
i am sorry to say but no, find employment.
you do not have to get married, as you could just become someone's partner.
do not do it if you are looking for advice.
don't get used and be true to yourself.
try to watch both straight and gay porn.
anything's possible, like when a woman wed a dolphin.
be yourself, honest, and confident...then it's all meant to be.
it boosts my ego when men hit on me.
behave yourself as i do not think your behavior now is appropriate.
it sounds like he has issues being faithful.
i do not let my girlfriend wait on me.
he loves me and would never be unfaithful towards me.
i frequently tell my man that i like him.
would u like to sit in the driver's seat?
i like the cowgirl position with the lights on
she probably broke it off because you're an asshole.
omg! he's talking to you!?
most importantly, have a good time!
they don't play around with sex/not a game!!!!
who dont like sex i heart it
i need to talk with him, feel like crap if i dont
we all just cra cra
awesome, i still gotta lot to go.
you’ll find someone better!!
guys like some mistery in girls.
i’m so happy she’s my wife!!
but that's not bad, if your with a responible person and you like it.
marriage will come, when your ready.
just send him a little note.
never mind your age, just run !
tell him about the phone call.
i find that honesty is effective for me, and you should consider it.
he didn't take your feeling into account at all.
you will get over him, it is just hard right now.
i have been married three times and have two sons.
he is marrying a woman, correct?
politely ask why you haven't heard from her for some time.
the women you have been hanging around are not good for you.
if he's really hot what do you do about it?
better 'fess up or she'll think you're hiding something.
liar! if you're really in love your relationship will stay solid no matter what happens.
it doesn't matter where you are, you can always spread rumors about her.
it's on you if she does it again.
you're doing what's right. just get a divorce and move on.
then just ask her out
i cannot play with him for long because we have _num_ small kids.
you shouldn't have them around babies they're diseased.
no one likes everything about their looks.
yr not really aksing anything tho
life's super, that the solution !
nothin' better to do, so i guess
where u live at
consider he dont even want to talk to you
having younger friends will help you feel younger.
yes, surprise her with it, and then keep giving her little gifts during dinner!
they're friends but boyfriends too.
tell him the kids need him.
you get what ya pay for in life.
but they still want sex with ya
don't sweat it, everyone's attracted to other ppl
my grandma is better at telling this story
yeah, men think about sex more than girls
just admit you were thinking about it
check it out first and see where it goes from there.
you know that didn’t end well, right?
well, what do you want to do now?
people don’t care about strangers these days.
no matter how you feel, go to the wedding anyway.
my bff is a dude weve never been more than that
shit u should be pissed
time for a lie dector test then ask
not for me though
yeah love isnt found via the internets
go ask her to be your date
you're smart and can do a lot of stuff
girl go for it!
he's playing with his friend
if you're shy, just say it close to his eyes.
if he's such a jer, he's not worth your good loving.
you need to talk about it with him and ask him to quit.
why would you ask something so stupid, common, and simple?
your _num_ year old kid already has a dad.
_num_, close to _num_ wbu?
a lady should be down for you and nothing else.
go to henderson, nc. there is a good amount of them here.
if your already fucking then its best just to keep having sex anyway
were not able to read minds.
some peeps just need a push.
if that don't work i don't freakin know.
sorry to say but she was cheating on ya, man.
if she likes the beach think about a bahamas weekend
its a sure thing if you really love her
since you don't know her style don't but a girl some clothe unless she picks them
don't be in a hurry, be like patient
go slow and try to make it perfect
don't play games you'll lose
don't think you won't enjoy it lol
jon and i used to be best friends.
she may not be with you anymore and tell you that
tell them you love em and move on.
sorry, don't know where he is.
dogs are like family, trust me.
what can i say to make her lose lbs?
they have lots of suggested items at that location.
don't let anybody tell you different.
a man's booty is an important part of his body.
a simple way of saying he wants to hook up.
i could not hurt someone i care for.
i'm not sure, i may be mixed.
some random guy sometimes asks why are all woman so slutty?
don't run but make sure you tell him to slow down!
so what do i need to do for her?!
yea i already said that earlier.
he doesn't care if he knows!
take a cruise and push her off the ship.
it's up to you, the sitch is in your hands.
it's not great for the one holding the loot.
possible, but i won't track him down.
my neighbor's messing with you.
i've never had sex with an unattractive man
please make her wear a bra because thats so gross not too
why not just call and ask?
bisexual chicks are hot, i've date a lot of them.
men like freedom, don't act like you own him.
i find italian women hot.
i'll give you _num_ points for that answer!
don't give up if it doesn't work out, hold your head up and keep trying.
show him that you care by listening if he speaks about it.
people are rather unintelligent.
i only say this in a friendly way.
consider how problematic it would be for him to be in a relationship with a girl who is in junior high school.
were you wrong on that personal thing?
do not go out with a stranger. please be careful
don't worry about it as long as you're fine with it
this isn't bad at all
if you're fine with it then whatever lol
if he's doing it on his own you should keep an eye on him
guys aren't afraid of the word love
they forced us apart, but i wont stop loving him
follow your gut feelings even if it leads you down the wrong path.
i didn't enjoy sleeping with someone with small equipment.
what about the experience did you like so much?
some clubs are best to have a good time.
sometimes friends find out they were destined to be together when they date.
if you got boy questions, i got answers.
i really dig dirty phone talk with my bf.
you gotta figure out how to know what people are all about, you feel me?
go get something he'd wanna see you wearing.
you drew them in with your caring ways.
i'd like to be his friend, thats all.
i hope everything turns out alright for you.
men to not appreciate woman who proclaim what's necessary.
you do not have to feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down, life is too short to let things worry you.
i am very much so, in my darling's eyes.
you already know a lot about each other.
i felt that way about a woman once. i am unable to explain why.
alternatively, simply pretend he is not present.
do not take him back if you are considering it.
you do not know what a threat you are.
speak with your eyes, not your mouth.
i like a great kisser, but i love great sex!
you're confused, and dont know what you want from life right now.
depends on you. but do you want it to happen?
if he's gonna marry her, then she can't have been sleeping around a lot in her past.
it's gotta be something in the water!
what kind of buddy are you looking for?
nope, he might want to talk to you before he falls asleep is all.
probably it's the only thing that we value above good health in human terms.
you know they're just using you, right?
you'll own him when you have sex.
sex is dirty and serious but making love is fun.
i get that way sometimes.
cuz some guys get tunnel vision when they're around beauties like me :p
women often talk about that when they get together.
maybe you just like bad boys?
you can probably do better
make sure you show your best side when she's around
i personally would want my daughter to be a homosexual. i comprehend how men are.
they are not worth your time and thoughts.
well, how do i tell him that i am now pregnant with his child, without him going ballistic?
begin with kissing then continue on to more advanced things.
well it just depends on the girl.. i'm a big liar and suckers believe me all the time
no need to worry about that embarrassment factor.
stick your nose into her privates.. i guess?!?
i know a girl who was married to a douche bag, who beats her kids.
you gotta find someone new if you're that upset
stick it out if he understands.
you may want to stay friends with him.
i do not know the person you met.
if your future husband cheated on you, how would you feel about that?
you're charming smiles doesn't cost a single cent.
someone will find you if not.
well, you can apologize, but, you will not get him back, you made your decision, so you have to live with it.
well, in this situation, i'm similar to your female friend, you're akin to my spouse!
they're in love, they believe they have hope.
i am not on the list.
hes your man, you know if hes all good or not
theres just no reason
just cause hes big dont mean he aint a hottie!
should i go back out or should i stay in??
why is he you’re boyfriend?!?
i’ve gained _num_ pounds!!!
it could lead to love.
i try to find married men
and now i’m single at _num_
you get hitched cuz you wanna be with that dude forever!
there might be a tiny bit of her that don't wanna, but she probably really does.
that's excellent and we need to say thanx to him for the great sexy feelings!
it boils down to books about dream meanings, and if you believe that stuff or not.
let me guess, you'll relocate to new zealand?
what will you be doing as i eat my chocolates and enjoy my roses?
when i saw that word for the first time, my friend told me what it meant.
this guy has not been in a relationship for a significant amount of time.
i'm unable to comprehend why i squandered a large portion of my lifetime in a relationship with a low-quality person such as yourself!
fine unless shes the boss
oh yeah for sure way out there people
cant wait to do the same to _num_
if someoneo ugly if they dont get asked out?
marriage aint no joke
there is no point in being miserable because he does not accept you for you.
do a provocative dance for him.
iwould treat you with about the same degree of respect and consideration i do a store-bought dessert.
ubanyone lie about being _num_?
you might loose them if you hide.
hey be patient.. it's been only _num_ months
wanna have sex for more than _num_ minutes?? then don't have kids!
no way he cheated if he did it.
i'm pretty sure she still lives with her parents
why do u care??
cant help what u dream & fantasy is fantasy, thats urs
watch out makes for more jealousy and stuff
no way would i post stuff like that
just be you, can't please everyone, start w/u
you should follow your gut if you have doubts about him
like i'm gonna buy he doesn't have some reason not to like you?
now i wanna know too, what was that about?
you been through that before?
well if he likes you you'd better go with him
get your friend to tell them guy you like him
it ain't done until it's done.
uh no, u need to be smarter than that.
you're a better person now than before her.
do just tell the man that you want to screw his sister.
try being the woman and you’ll probably find “the one”.
i’m almost _num_ and i’ve been with my husband since i was _num_
get to know his personality by spending time together.
actually, i like falling in love, until i am hit by the gravity of it.
i'm really busy right now so i can't reply.
they couldn't be apart from each other for very long
why not give her a phone card, or send her a valentine in the mail?
ask him where he thinks his life is going?
its all about the money
start to get to know her
i became drawn to someone whom until before now i wasn't into until they asked me out , thus just ask
i guess she dislikes me because of the flirting & all the talk between us
don't want to cause problems!
despite the fun that can be had it doesn't mean being a couple
all guys aint the same it justs depends on each guy.
you have to have a cents of humor.
repeat after me.. youre a crappy person!!
you gotta tell him you love him.
everybody wants to be loved
once you've moved on you won't care if he has
pains so much like pleasure that bleedings like coming!!!
the best way is to tell them.
may you be preserved with the help of god and your fellow soldiers.
then, you know what you have to do then, forgive them.
if you cheat once, you will most likely cheat again.
damn, you need tell that biatch "i hate you, back off".
i don't care about her past, i only care who she is now.
you have to understand that mom and dad are happy now that they have seperated.
nah, your prettier at night because you're fathers sleeping, lmfao.
it's so sad, but you have to believe that it will happen when the time is right.
will u marry me?
stay with both and see how it goes, trust me i’ve got experience v
if he wants to be friends, that’s fine.
you’re always sooo happy and glowing.
marriage isn’t easy but it’s better.
the gay boys love to listen to that stuff!!
check it out, kiss her and wait to see what happens next!
if she's not feeling you, you can forget it.
when you're in love you cannot be with other people.
don't lose sight of you, it's not good to focus only on her.
what kind of restaurant does she like?
now you get two of each of them.
i don't agree that it's the female's job to ask first.
perhaps you should both take s hot bath.
i suggest do not be serious about getting into a serious relationship.
perhaps it was an unwise thing for him to tell you, but in any event you should not worry about it.
if you really love him, you shouldn't want anything else.
if my hubby ever cheated, i'd probably cut off his penis and hang it from the mirror of my mustang.
love can be weird for guys.
don't compromise your faith for anyone.
there is so many exciting things to live for.
maybe open it and then ask her.
tell him you love him no matter what.
try to make her think you like her in a different way.
my man is always looking at other chicks when he's driving but he tries not to be notices.
you should treat him if you haven't seen a friend in forever.
would you sleep with multiple people?
that dude is messing with you.
once i thought about it, i realized i want them both/
conjure me up in a dream and then float into my life.
what turns you on in a woman? her voice, her looks? the way she treats other peopel?
ilike him, and he likes me too.
i adored this man, however, subsequent to my humiliation by him in front of a _num_-person crowd, i'm unsure of my emotions!
you need to break up with him. then he might realize he had someone good.
only if it feels kul to you.
have i told you recently that i like you?
i don't know how to let him go.
i want a friend to talk to.
we've been through a lot.
it's fine if you don't mind being her fallback.
take a condom with you.
get a man for yoself
is this to far?
if you are naked and in bed with someone, you are gonna fuck
you will no, if you are into him.
stop trying to run her life.
my guy says it lets him tell me how great i look.
think about how that makes you look to his buddies.
it don't matter what she does for a living, she can tbe a stripper for all i care.
i feel that they should get married at this time.
the one you think is your boyfriend is not a real boyfriend.
i love only worrying about myself.
is there something wrong?
ooh, also were men aware of your comment, you'd be severely unpopular, for your edification.
provide him with all the necessary info.
(use caution if he's a non-comprehending caveman)
yup, sharp sense of humor, great disposition and self-esteem!
i feel bad for guy number _num_ if she's thinking about guy number _num_
he's so adorable, but listen to me, i find myself wondering about his thought process now and then. ha ha.
you can pick me, but be clear on types or stereo because age is also a factor!
why is she wanting to be nosy?
i don’t enjoi hurting people.
she deserves credit for sticking with it even when she finds it upsetting.
my boyfriend, who i have been dating for just over a year, has lied to me continuously throughout our entire relationship.
did he do it on purpose?
you can trust us, because you would know if we lie.
ask her about her feelings and why she is with u
its bc they like to make u feel bad
anwser men are not understandable
love my baby daddy aka my bf!
think u already made up ur mind about sleeping w/him
can't they show us some respect??
that, for sure really pissed me off!
umm r u supposed to sign that??
thinking that god doesn't care about sexual procliviites?? what a narrow mind!
a nice wedding in the yard was good enough for me.
although, i am glad that i had married him, people are freaking out about that.
just in the event your heart is desirous of it; if your instinct is to flee, proceed to behave thusly.
someone who is unfaithful once will be unfaithful again.
you should wait until you hear what she has to say.
he prolly thinks you got knocked up on purpose.
no offense to the good guys.
i don’t know about that.
don’t try to get her to be a stripper!!!
my bffl had a date with a tiny guy, and they actually kissed!
if "sure" is his answer, he ain't screwing around on you.
she loves you like she'd love her brother.
if i did, then how come i'm going through his things?
he is not lonely.
no, that means that you are the girl of my dreams.
terminate your relationship with him.
i hear a coat vacuum will take care of it.
break up with him and do not listen to his excuses because he does not love you.
you're only noticing what she looks like.
if you don't reach out now, you'll never be in contact.
if you're good all the time, it's nice to step it up sometimes.
we also have hormones, for your information.
no unless you're not sure.
i love you so much baby!
i think you can find something better to do in life than trying to figure out men.
i think you should just chill out for a bit.
sometimes i like to go across the country to my hometown, just to get away for a bit.
try having sex right before you go to sleep
say yes if you're down for him, say no if you're not.
i would choose black dudes because white men aren't as hott.
it really depends. . . does he like war games, sports, etc.
i don't want him to be my boyfriend anymore.
i really think that they are loved because they wouldn't find it if they weren't
i got to play a lot more with the laid back caoch.
everyone has there own way of thinkin’.
it will help your love life too.
keep going till you get to level _num_!!
i’ll be able to help since i’m fluent in idiot, gruntinese and jabberwocky!
you can figure this out if you go to the uk yourself.
most women on campus can't stand him.
guys love staring at our breasts.
dump the girlfriend and she'll be shocked!
speak up and say something in your defense.
get her a gift then ask her
dont even know if u r a dude or a chick how can i anwser?
no worries love comes all the time
she really needs to get on it before she gets preggos
kick his ass out if he's screwing around on you.
start from the day you got married.
i have a ton of friends, both guys and chicks.
the future is not looking good.
talk it out if your worried aobut it.
i hate wearin flats, i aint gunna wear em for a guy.
if he loves you it's gunna kill him, but he'll be fine eventually.
why did ya marry a quiet guy when you wanted someone to talk to.
don't do the deed if you have't yet
what kinda dad does that make him?!
you need to be around a man that's rough around the collar for a while
problem is i can't tell if she likes me the same
i only like emotionally strong people though
the meaning is she is fond of you in a brotherly fashion.
that is only effective in bad teenager movies.
there was not enough feelings there for her that he would leave his wife.
stay with your sister if need be.
i haven't gone wrong yet going out with a friend
do you really think he's just playing with my feelings?
i can't stand being around those potty mouths
i have a problem saying no to a friend without causing problems
there are snugglers and non-snugglers in this world.
yeah, she was invited, she came over to my room, and the door was closed.
romantic love is so much fun.
you seen the game?
wait to say i love you
i'd rather die than work anymore.
don't think about all the stupid times, think about the good stuff
saw them last they and they were alright.
she's not in college? do you want to go to jail?
shoot him an email if you're stuck.
the more you think about her, the more you will want her.
sometimes sex is all i have on my mind.
go for it, do it loud and proud, then she will know how much you care.
that'll really make it worse!
maybe you werne't as in love as you thought you were when you got hitched.
when someone hurts you, then you will have someone else to fall back on.
tell her to try to ask him to go out with her or something.
i believe he is seeing a non-respectable woman.
if she will not remain faithful to you, she is not worth it.
if you like him, you should go on a date with him.
she can't stop you from seeing your child.
a man's man would never bribe you to kill your child.
stop contacting him and see if he misses you
correct your daughter for her foolishness.
it may be the same way you said it to us.
and i didn't have kids who depend on me i would die for my one true love.
why are so many men into asian girls.
look i need help figuring out what i need to do.
cheat on her with her best friend and treat her like a queen
tell her to stop making bad choices with these bad boys.
a lot of my friends' girlfriends have asked me a similar question.
i am trying to solve that problem myself.
try to kiss him to see if you have any feelings for him?
my boyfriend truly enjoys my toes.
do it when u see him again or when before he goes
my adivce i a man take it slow there
can u hear yourself right now???
basically lead him by saying what you want.
he can not get a girl to share.
you become disinterested easily when you are with him or her.
you know what you have to do.
even a daisy can answer "he loves me, he loves me not."
one day we were sitting on a bench and the park and i just told him how i felt
she was wondering if she hurt my feelings or something...she's always questioning me.
the answer would depend on how short or long of a time you've been together.
knowing stuff ahead of time can cause us to change our behavior.
you are in deep shit.
when she gets free, she will if she wants to.
that's not gonna be a problem.
there's so many gowns and bridesmaid dresses, it could take moths to decide on your own!
the changes started later that month.
it's not fine and being a guy doesn't make it ok.
jamookae has mental issues but i'd still choose him.
i was wondering about how to kiss her the next time.
i am just stating my opinion!
i am not one of them.
whaaaat? why kill a baby
she doesnt like u like that
be cool and let her know how u feel
might come to ya otherwise its just not _num_
do step two if nothing changes after three weeks.
he doesn't like the outfits you pick for him most of them time.
what should i do? he messed up but i still love him.
check it, just because you have a man, does not mean a dude won't try to hollar.
roses are red, but violets are blue
do what you gotta, you are the right one here
wifee isn't pushing for sex like she used to
i do care, but that's not a big deal
think nothing of it, he will understand.
you elope with the person you can't stand to live without.
yes, you should move on and attempt to find a new relationship. there are plenty of single people out there.
you basically have to overdose in order to feel anything.
if you don't like dildos, then it won't work for you.
sorry, it will always be weird.
how do i get it outta there?
how can i help her if i don't know who she is?
my mother taught me to be an honorable man so say what you will, but i do my best to be honest and faithful.
i've never been a teach but i sure appreciate the job they do.
lots of guys like girls in glasses, just ask me, i've had plenty of boyfriends.
i just need to meet the woman of my dreams then it'll be all good
it was after i caught him cheatin on me
dont go after married men, it makes you look triflin'
i like to dream about other guys, i don't see a problem with it
tell him when you are in private at the right moment.
thirty is relatively young to be getting heavier.
stand ua ground, and let him know it is over.
your age is too low and an excess of negative events can result.
he is done with you because he got what he wanted.
try pet stores and maybe barns!!
if you’ve found someone else let him do the same.
i’d be with you if i knew that!
we barely know each other, i can’t love you.
you waited too long and missed you’re chance.
she is probably distracted by other things and doesnt know when someone is into her.
it doesn't make sense if you're attacted to her but you aren't a lesbian.
we can discuss this later
don't tell him, show him what you really like.
if you aren't married, other guys would be interested in you.
someone is tracking his every step.
tell her to find something to do with her life.
you'll be unable to do what your speaking about.
in the event he actually is unfamiliar with the females, it should have no impact.
he will love you more.
my wifee kissed me, then left with the children.
my contact information is _num_@yahoo.com. i enjoy meeting new people.
i do not know. perhaps i am simply incapable of lying too much.
that is what i decided on matt.
you can go to the beach or a restaurant.
it does not mean that he does not love you.!!
it sounds as though he is pretending not to be interested and you are not.
i like the doggystyle position.
last saturday i had to act like a chick and a dude at least _num_ times.
try to get his attention, who cares if it dosen't work.
knock his ass out!
you are asking all the right questions, you should go for that job.
he's the first one you should talk to.
i really do not think much about it.
however, each time i return, the same difficulties arise again.
if she likes you, she will accept that you're a beginner.
you certainly should! you ought to break up with him.
wwe are now friends after i asked her to dance.
call her and tell her you love her!!!
it's good your experiencing new things!
they speak the truth
use it or youll lose it!
don't be late or someone else will beat you to it
true enough...but are you truly in love?
he's now claiming they mean nothing to him.
if you can't handle your own dirty work, get someone else to break it to him.
he must have been your friend at one time.
you sista mighat know the answer to your problem.
that depends if you are a man or women.
are you trying to say that im not a cool person?
there's plenty of women on earth
forget about it go live your life have fun
it shouldn't matter if you like her
they weren't hers to begin with so it really shouldn't bother her
ppl can never be what u r!
u don't see them. just feel them. brrr
nah, don't worry about things like that.
oh the times when he makes you feel that way. it's amazing!!
i'm a guy, the answer has gotta be sex!
all i know is that men rock...they're strong, tough, responsible and work dang hard.
share a question that made you bust a gut.
get away from her, she's a first class user!
best of luck, bub.....i don't like your odds.
do not ask him. annoy him until he asks you on a date.
you should look over photos of young men.
he either wants a break, thinks you are boring, or he is seeing someone else.
you can do this, but please do not do it, you deserve more.
i'm uncertain since my spouse-to-be and myself both have that quality.
if you love and trust her, she love you even more
i am very loud so neighbors have complained
he want be married anytime soon.
i think about wrestling the same way.
you will know it, when you feel it.
yes, everyone was using french, but this works too.
if you find out, let me know.
is there another reason you shouldn't go out with him.
follow your heart and your mind.
it's hard to get over jealousy.
i think it would be awesome
sweetie, trust me- i'm a dude.
ask your sister again
read this and say stop
my boo isn't bad, he just ditches the foreplay.
check my avatar and look at my questions. they're all pretty close to the same thing.
i'm confused cuz he's got a bunch of girls as friends.
its good to be in a couple
lay a big fat one on him
please get back with me!!!!!!!
at least you are in it
getting a chick goin gets me goin
tell him the get lost brooo!
here's an idea for v-day.. got her some roses and ask her out!
well u don't really have to ask her to be your gf
if you have a crush on him go ask him out
uhm, if it's *during* sex she ain't no virgin
hit me up at _num_@hotmail.com, we'll discuss it later
there ain't even a free lunch or fireworks
i welcome your imput
i have a hard time talking with the ladies.
you gonna ask in a text!? that's just lame!
take it easy with the planning, ya know.
she has been living for you.
this is the first time i have ever done something for someone else, advice would be lovely.
it's ridiculous that a guy can't even talk to another chick without his girl thinkin he's steppin' out
i was chatting with some guy for like _num_ hrs
you're such a tree-hugger
it just means you like yourself
stick up for yourself no matter what
the exact reason why so many women are so stupid.
your life is over if you do it.
i want it bad but i also want it to mean something.
if it's a new one every week, i doubt it, but you can look for signs like flirting and eye contact.
don't wory dearie, love conquers all.
trust me because i concider myself a realationship doctor
if i'm into a guy i ask him out before another girl can
to develop that takes time
i'm sure bill gates was probably super geeky and had no one to go out with on a friday night but look at him now!!!
regardless of sex, god is happy when two people have mutual love.
men want women to behave nicely in public and promiscuously in private.
idk, maybe show some love with a home cooked meal.
ask around and sea if your friends know him.
she don’t want you.
if you use it well then size don’t matter.
i don’t care bout my bf’s.
why don't you date one of his friends and see how he likes it?
you got to get to work, dude
where are some fun places for us to hang after school?
sit her ass down and tell her she need to grow up
we girls are better liars than guys
everyone thinks you're a jerk.
then figure out if he wants to stick with you.
you can't just push yourself on someone or you will be alone.
don't be acting so holier than thou.
you should just go introduce yourself!
i'll try anything one time and another time, if i like it.
i love older men becuz they r more mature
do u wanna spend your life with a person like that? really??
well if your gut feeling says something's off, then it is true.
don't be a clueless idiot.. be smart enough.
nowadays most people are not virgins!
the main decision is who i want to marry.
either or... it just depends what we are in the mood for and what day it is.
he is a liar and hangs up when i try to say anything.
why not just do it because waiting won't get you anywher.
he's just ruining his life right?
nah but who is happy anyway?
do you like being hit on?
it sucks, everything reminds me of him and what we don't have
i feel like he's going to jail even though you said it was mutual
i can love someone after a month.
you can't love someone you can't trust.
why my ex still be jealous.
what be the worst thing they say?
have your family take pics and record it if you rent.
thanks, i will tell her, but she may act like that again.
i don't worry to much about it
are you and your partner still an item?
you probably won't like it but just pretend you do.
if you want to set the mood, try some barry white songs.
who says you have to have a relationship.
i'ma _num_ old lady.
too much of a good thing, is not always a good thing.
just be your self
it's ok to cry when you're talkin to her.
it's about who you're with.
i suggest that you focus first on becoming a friend to a woman.
i would be very disappointed if i got taht same kiss today.
my girlfriend is perfect, my love, my everything.
it is hard to find friends.
i know because my ex did the same thing to me.
a little bit of both.
behave naturally and observe the occurrences.
you will say 'you can't hurt me anymore' when you are angry.
go get a breast reduction, and you'll look great.
you are not getting any, my friend.
i would not break up with my girlfriend for someone who sent me nude photographs.
he is just talking, do not run.
they better not cheat on you and write you a note about it.
don't talk to him, he;s not the one for u!. he's giving bad advice!
when i see him i know i made the right choice.
hes _num_ and never had sex
it's going to depend on whether or not you still have feelings for her.
you shouldn't be sleeping with him anyway
it don’t matter if nobody else likes him but its ok if you do
he had the nerve to have sex with his best friend’s wife.
they are really nice
tell me, what that means?
who’s gonna put me back together again?
if your best mate isn't making this suggestion, i would disagree.
you ain't going to get nowhere with them, so leave them and let them go.
i am always seeing others thru rose colored glasses... as the way i want them to be.
i only did it because i didn't want to feel lonely.
i have no doubt that they feel the same way about females.
less than every single female, however, certain females behave in such a manner.
i would be worried if they dodge the question and/or get angry.
if he truly loved you he would not have wanted you to have an abortion.
was his response that you should stay the cours, that he was mistaken, or that he did not love you?
i would like to have you next to me.
why do men always lie alot?
if she wants to mess with your head its time to dump her for somebody better
look for a hangout with someone other than losers
don't do anything your going to hate yourself for
if i marry the girl of my dreams i'd have all my dreams covered
i’ve been to a few of them before.
i go for tall guys with muscles.
most guys aren’t stupid.
gotta say mine is pretty big.
need some help girls, u should be able to tell when a girls into u.
are u certain that is what you want?
in the event he communicates a farewell to you, your relationship was not destined to be.
are you even still not familiar with the paris hilton video recording?
i need someone i can really love.
both of you should attempt to be understanding, to adjust accordingly.
some light hair is fine, but not really hairy how men's chests can become.
tell your family that the person makes you happy.
support her if she is fine with her appearance.
no i did not, i waited until the man asked me out on a date.
the man is married!
tell em you love em and see what they say in return.
you should be upset!
why do you wanna be with someone who doesn't know what they want?
my friends hate himand they mock him.
you are a such jerk you suck!!!!
how do we make them stay wiith us its hard i think.
send a text pls
god says its a true sin not to be pure.
he is _num_ to _num_ then let meknow how old are u?
you happy, hot, and all grown up.
it's bs when men pull that crap.
it can't be all hairy
be with someone who wants to be with you for the long haul.
he loves you, because you are his.
he thinks it's a good thing.
turn offs are body odor, farts, and constant burping.
i think about him to this day still.
just ask him on a date and see what he says.
it was the past, and with different girls.
you can't change them, trust me!
do not let him or anyone else, talk to you like that!
being a virgin on our wedding night, meant so much to him.
seriously? if your really in love, hop on a plane and go get married already!
i love watching a girl get off, as soon as she's done i'm hopping on top...
tell her how you feel.
why can women be friends but men can't?
stay calm and treat girls right.
somewhere inside yourself you are strong.
she will break up her current relationship and make a move.
in such an event, what's the duration of your marriage?
inquire as to whether he feels affection for your progeny. if not so inclined, end the relationship since relatives occupy first position.
that is another story.
would i tell my husband to leave?
i've heard that men prefer virginal women.
do you take issue with this?
i apologize, but since i do not live there i cannot give you advice.
you are a sinner if the people you call friends are unsaved.
i recommend going to movies, going sight-seeing, and other similar activities.
we frequently meet and have similar feelings.
inform her that you've been wishing to share with her some information.
you'll want it more then once
he did it once he'll do it again!
you need to get out
i miss him so much. i care so much about him
why can't you just be happy with yourself?
i hope thats not true, i already have issues with gay people wanting me
supposedly my friend loves me
theres probably some other reason for why she eats that way
have you heard this before?
they only want to be loved!
i want her to like me.
my dad and great grandma were mad about the interacial relationship.
i'm trying to say that beauty is only skin deep
because red is for blood, so we say blue is for love.
do you really want to get back with him?
you didn't even wipe when you used that restroom!!
best thing is to walk away and be on your own.
that was unfortunate. in the future, at no time will the television be powered simultaneously as sexual intercourse occurs.
you will be a good sister.
he started flirting with me one day.
men will be jealous that you're interested in him, and not them.
it's so natural, why make and issue out of it?
don't email or text him, tell him directly to his face.
the dang headboard threw the whole thing off the rails...no satisfaction for me!
i'm totally in love with my wife.
if he thinks its a good idea, ask him out for coffee.
i am _num_ and ain't having sex until i'm married.
he lacks confidence, is that the opinion?
he don't want to use no condom
will she know that you like her without telling her.
i am starting to fall in love, so i can't
chicks ove it when you are weird.
someone you love will be there if you are happy or sad, always.
then you can definitely do these things together!
don’t do it, that’s simple.
how hard have you really tried?!?
a women never stops working, but a man stops when the sun goes down.
sounds like flirting the way you mentioned it.
she says that she doesn't like being alone, and that is the girl you like.
i don't love him, i just like him.
it don't matter if your doing everything right.
if you never try to have a relationship, you will never what might have happened between the two of you.
do not be afraid to tell him what you want.
you are beginning to dislike the friends of the person to who you love.
but, do you know what i had to do to overcome this?
you should try love because it is not bad.
some guy followed me in a store and acted scary.
sex should be about giving, not getting, you can't be selfish!
tell her that if she's feeling horny for you, come on over, have sex and swallow your cum.
kinda like suicide, ok to think about but not to do.
my guy friends all swear that confidence is the key.
if he loves you even the little things will be important.
i think about him all the time.
you can get ideas off the knot website.
you are already married, so what is the problem?
he will ask for your hand in marriage.
i want a man to be true to himself.
you can do what you like.
the ones that come from out of nowhere, are the one that are truly genuine from the heart.
i would sacrifice my life for the woman i love because if she died i would not want to live any long.er
if he gets out of line, get on him about it.
he wouldn't be cool with me doing it either.
don't let him know you want to get freaky with him.
you should be worried when he sees other people.
i don't know anything about love.
i'm telling you i am everything you want.
even if we don't agree, i would still be friends.
i use yahoo! chat to talk a lot.
you should become accustomed to men devaluing you as a person.
have intercourse with people who are good at mathematics. they know how to handle curves.
_num_ not circumcised penis is pretty nasty!!!!
one day you wake up with the knowledge.
trust me that i know, i am married.
be careful having sex, you could get knocked up.
he is controlling you, girl, get out now.
i don"t understand how you feel, but i don't like the mean people.
he should take you how you are.
god does not seem to bother but love is love.
that seems unfair to the guy you're dating now.
money can buy you a lot of things, class, grace and style ain't on that list.
it depends, how big is his penis?
i tried talking to him but he won't call me back.
my guy looks hot because he works out all the time.
i would not doubt him.
raise yourself, because he has no obligation to feed you.
stay with him if you want to be with him.
ask him. you might feel awkward, but the awkward moment will be worth it if he does love you.
i you are in bangalore, then i am here.
i'm always happy including when waking up this morning and at work right now.
tou must inqire of yourself whether you have feelings for him!
if she is not willing, stop trying to do it.!>
however, i have learned that a man will show it if he really likes you.
by then you won't be speaking with her, if or when your sentiments change.
there is no tension between me and my guy friends, who are like brothers to me.
what did you do in that class?
i would ask her if she likes you or not.
that is very insensitive of her to do such things in your presence.
i am always attracted to boorish men. what is wrong with me?
cling and pray to jehovah god, and to his son jesus christ, as your last recourse!
hang out with her, go shopping with her if need be.
i promise that all girls who think they're sex obsessed have no idea.
you'll be charged _num_ points for each answer.
i think it's a myth that guys are addicted to sex.
you need to leave him alone if he got what he was after and doesn't want to talk to you now.
can you help me i need advice ?
the only thing your child cares about is your presence money doesn't matter.
don't just sit and wait around for good things to happen
my wife and i are having trouble conceiving please give us advice.
hmm i think it depends on what mood my wife is in.
two marriages under my belt, the first one i just knew right away and the _num_ one is still coming undone.
send me an email and i will tell you everything that i know.
you already said that he's in love with another chick!
confidence is sexy, so believe in yourself.
cause, they ain't thinking straight!
stay out of this until time calms them down.
men will not consider cheating if the sex remains interesting and exciting.
just take it slow and check out her body language.
most girls just want attention. and chocolate!
i really hate that word!!
depends on you’re age.
when you give love it comes back to you in love.
you messed up! even if you didnt like the place he picked you should of went with it.
tell him he needs to respect you before you can respect him!
you get back what you give no more.
i have to know. have you committed a felony or in jail?
finding love is the real reason for your success.
adopt the persona of a young lady searching for an nsa coupling and send an im to him.
it hurts your partner if you go out for fun when you are in a relationship.
i want to be with my ex boyfriend.
oh goodness, that must have been a really hard feeling.
some guys don't want anyone touching their butt
most people dont believe in love until they fall into love
dont you mean how long into the first date?
some guys care about more than just sex
maybe there is a reason they acted like that
i do not think my bottom is like that of a chicken.
i am a woman and only think about sex if i am in love with a man.
if he has friends, then maybe he is interested in you.
i am unsure, but if you find mine please let me know as i would like it returned.
i think he will cheat you sometime because he already cheated your cousin.
you are not considerate unless to return the favor.
i miss him and if anyone knows him, please send me an email.
what kind of relationship you think you got if this stuff is off limits to talk about?
i dont think this is a sin even though it ends with screwing
if you're going to do it at least enjoy it
sounds like your virginity is more important to you than most guys.
i really loved my boyfriend but we broke up.
it really opened my eyes.
marriage, what do you think bout it?
even though he's been with the kid, can i get custody?
think u have a bf
can owrk for u _num_
once bffs now no more
was his best friend we didnt get together
he even accepted my littel baby girl as his own.
don't blow all your money buying things.
u need to figure it out what u dont like to do
even if u don't dig the stuff she does, get involved anyway.
that dont make no sense - she's hiding one thing or another.
if i'm not in the mood, its not gunna happen
guys just want sex
can u handle a relationship
give her one in front of everyone and observe her reaction.
have you read what you have written?
you are the best at it.
yyou will know him better if you continue to flirt, and care for him.
when it comes down to it, it is my choice.
no matter how long it takes to not give a damn about them.
i can give you a few bucks if you pay me back.
should i break up with her or just wait and see what happens?!?
interrupt her mid sentence for a real surprise.
true love doesn’t just die so quick.
i like him but idk if he digs me.
i want it more than dudes.
think about how they feelin right now.
then tell me what the hell i need to do.
a woman wants a lot from dudes.
if u like it email me
good pick. not a bad opition
she knows your happy since the break up
exclusively one, the initial and the concluding.
because once you have something more serious than a friendshup, it is difficult to return to being friends.
the admiration is friendly and just not enough reason to kiss.
you can tell if it is too long if the woman finds it painful and it does not fit.
you can not change their mind, or make them put the toilet seat down.
he wants you to do this so he feels more comfortable cheating.
i would be suspicious of him being unfaithful.
no i am not soft on discipline, i am just trying to be fair.
it is a way of showing that she does not want to attract other men.
that is what men do.
he did not want a second chance.
he is gonna be jealous. let him know you don't like that either.
maybe you got too clingy after you slept together, it scares guys away sometimes.
little girl, it's ok if you don't want to have sex with a guy.
does it even matter since you got yours?
it's hard to get rid of all the good and bat times in my mind.
im shaba send me an amsterdam friend
women are into strong dudes
some dudes are different
if they don't like u for who u r, they don't deserve u
if they make you happy you won't wanna flirt
easy, buy a flower for him & tell him you love him
keep your boo, but go find another man on the side!
your momma made you go , so she ain't got no pull on you anymore
yeah that's the one thing the stick-in-the-mud women are really stuck on
so should i assume you've tried to talk to him?
if he only wants to be friends, on to the next one
don't listen to other people, ur smart enuf to make up ur own mind.
do u get a sick rush out of being mean to people who aren't mean to u?
let him go if he continues to harass you.
ghiving him a hug may not have been the best solution.
i have not met the right person yet.
i am quite mature, so it would be unwise to cross me.
hhy didn't they tell you?
there wz _num_, a wolf and a lab
send him a postcard while ur in bora bora
youll _num_ all bout him when u meet _num_ new
u can meet women other places too like the library or walmart even
yes it is possible; in fact, it happens to me frequently.
furthermore, you are hoping that he will propose marriage to you.
a girl is testing you when she looks towards you.
thank you for helping to plan my wedding!
the more you let him get away with, the more freedoms he will take.
try it you'll luv that babe.
hes too old get a young guy will do the trick
after she dump me like that she can drop dead today for all i care!!!!!!
the mind cant make up its own mind sometimes!!!!
it depends on the circumstances...
in my opinion a woman should make that decision for herself.
all the clues from the secret admirer led up to you.
if you break up with a guy, and he is not completely desperate, he probably will not ask you out again.
is the a possibility you could be pregnant?
you should ask him out on a date, if he is interested.
you should refuse to get together with her if she has been drinking.
i discovered that my girlfriend was actually a man.
be friendly, not direct, etc.
i like famous singers, and i have seen you on a cd!
everyone hurts everyone else, that's life.
they got to relax and be in the mood for love!
he wont care, just be straight wit him.
we've been talking for like _num_ months or so.
i hope you make a lot of new friends.
when i was there, i noticed that too!
no, the real reason is because men have different hormones than women.
i like my girls small up top and a nice ass.
how long will it be before im not jealous of his new girl?
if it's been too long, answer no
they wer easy to convince. can't blame you for that.
is the kid's dad involved?
why'd he get busted?
you should say you have enough friends.
you won't get into a lasting relationship unless your cock is big.
they have to deal with it.
my friend has no clue that she ruined me.
you have to get over it and find another person.
dudes can have chick friends _num_
i know he'll totally be into it
i'm not going to sleep with you out of pity man
is it normal to have sex with you boyfriend?
it has nothing to do with you.
don't wait for them to make the first move you should do it
nobody can know...at the end of it all, you're the one who decides.
nope, except if they said for sure that it isn't off anymore.
she ain't into you ...or it could be you were too in her face.
nothing wrong with that, as far as i can tell.
theres no doubt you're in love when all ya do is think about them.
you're _num_, stay in your age range/
people become violent idiots when they get hitched.
i think he's getting some on the side.
that depends on how things go.
if i had a dick, would ya wanna date me?
not only fo lovers
danger for friend vs stranger
i want to know what the deal is.
take it slow, no guy wants to hear that he's a bad kisser.
nope, cant be done, if they care about you its gonna hurt no matter how you say it.
we wanna get get to no each other better.
he's a kid, maybe _num_ or _num_, _num_ at the most and he has a thing for me.
act like you don't care, even if ya do.
make sure she knows you care so she knows
how do u know if a dude's flirting or not?
see if shes honest when she sends her reply.
tell em you love em and be flirty.
clock's runnin' and you need to roll
he yells while he's looking for his razor
she prolly wouldn’t have left you if you’d been calm.
you’re wasting the best years of you’re life on him, get rid of him.
we couldn’t think of anything better to do.
my sister broke up with him but she’s pregnant with his kid.
give her something sentimental.
when she's no longer attempting contact.
i forgot about an important question for women: have you ever used the sample cosmetics at the shopping mall?
there is still a sense of hope for these young women.
that's not true, most guys aren't stupid, they just act that way sometimes.
i never date large men, just not attrackted to them.
he's jim, i know it for a fact.
when she let's your sex life slide down the tubes.
hold off on the hanky-panky until he gets the point.
why is he giving me the cold shoulder?
later, i found out he wants me.
im starving at least twice a day.
ask her, shell probably love the help.
try places where black dudes hang out.
remember. even though all those ads are saying condoms don't offer enough protection : something is better then nothing.
could you find out for me plz.
sure she could maybe fake the basic movements and sounds, but trust me bro...she ain't faking that.
it all depends on the her and how she feels about herself.
only use it when they are wanting it too, or you know to add a little spice to the moment.
the best revenge is to move on and forget that he existed.
you need to be loyal, nice, friendly, and sweet.
you should keep it that way regardless of how angry she becomes.
at times is does not matter how you use it.
we try to make the ladies feel as comfortable as possible.
its also that he is tiny down there
how r u fixing the rust what is she like as a gf
right if ur are usually having sex
b/c they have _num_ track mind
tell him prob wont unless hes gay
have i told u today ur beautiful?
dont bother asking stupid ? like this _num_
their brains are just not as wise
love, no, but who knows.
he's not a junkie.
any man can run from responsiblity.
look around, we are in heaven and hell both.
i don't know what your saying, but its true.
your ideas were great but i got to read what you did.
either do something fun or keep busy.
if you feel like you need a man, then do it.
guys usually prefer the chase even though they like the hunt.
how do i know if he really loves me?
your question is making people aware of the fact that you are unattached.
or i am merely afraid or timid.
be careful you are going down a dangerous pathway.
it will hinder your ability to do amusing things with people.
correct, i imagine i'm attracted to criminal-type men.
go out and party and don't let things tie you down.
you'll see if you get naked in front of him.
id be thankful to you if you would tell em about me.
in one way id get her.
shell wait if she cares bout him.
i asked her twice to be my girlfriend but she don't answer.
u know what? what's inside is all that counts.
do married ladies still give blowjobs?
it needs to be up _num_ u
she will probably do the same - so find some better goes to be with.
if you can't stand to be "just friends" with him, then leave him alone.
love is a timeless flower, if you work at it, it will grow forever. <_num_
whatever makes you happy babe
most guys that are hot are really concieted
recently i broke up with my gf but its really hard to get another one... can you help pleeeaaassseee?
my dad's like that to
guys tell me im pretty :)
i love her and she knew i was there
she really likes you but only as a friend
i dont think infatuation is a real thing
imho u need to consider how mature the kid is
what does love even mean these days?
that would be true unless i discovered that i did not want it after all.
all people desire the ideal man, however, nobody appears to be amenable to acting as such.
not unless her age is twice your age.
which people are the most important to you?
she knows that it is time for her to move on, but she can not, do you have any suggestions that might help her?
hope he asked u out!
no way _num_ know
dating will be tough
prob as dumb as me
thats a big no
first come marriage then comes children
it depends on if youre young or not

nope, they cant cause deep down they really want each other!
he looks good and loves to flirt.
how can i get help?
he will find a girl who loves him.
if he says no, then he won't help.
do not be said, because i expect things to get better.
you're not very mature. you're best off speaking with your mother regarding that subject.
do not hurt his feelings and keep quiet.
only if they desire the circumstance to as great a degree as you.
my girlfriend really likes anal sex.
perhaps you married the wrong man.
seecond, if a man is unfaithful, you are associating with the incorrect men.
the man said 'i am a caveman'. the woman responded 'what's this?'.
if you love him a lot then do it.
i agree with _num_
keept a clear schedule for valentine's day.
even smart people can be dumb.
ugh, they'll get it eventually!
this isn't the best point in your life, so just relax and do it!
so, so you think they won't cheat???
crying works, but you would get a lot more out of talking.
it means they love you and want you back, duh!
i like kids, that doesn't mean i am one.
youre the one starting it
unless you have a perfect partner , its not a good idea though
you can only take the other person on their word. there is no other way to prove it.
you should tell him that your in love with him
if a guy or a girl can't be real, forgot about them.
sometimes he acts like he does it a lot.
did you sleep with someone else when you were with her?
talk about her hair, outfit or shoes if she is hot.
if a dude does that to me, i dump him.
no doubt that it depends on the man.
you've just answered yourself.
if you think that is what he is doing, then he probably is doing it.

you need to prove she cheated then get a divorce.
its cool that you feeling this girl.
you dont know what will happen that what love is all about it.
because we good to the same school.
i understand you think she ugly, but she happy with herself.
if you can't say this to his face, say it to yourself in the mirror while he is away.
aand you both have already had sexual intercourse?
thaat is because they do not use their head to think straight.
i became close with this guy.
most of the time, guys do not understand women, it is a scientific mystery!

he's not serious about her, he shouldn't get sad
are you sure she even like you?
quit having sex so quickly, it should be you decision when it happens.

maybe cause there is no one else like you.
you need to find someone mature, like you.
i know what your going thru, i have the same problem.
yeah, i don't like em.
what can i do when she's like that?
consider yourself, don't rush.
he's ignoring me right now.
go out for a night with your friends and cut loose.
i think you should ask him what would happen if you got married one day.
i think you should try speaking in a more manly voice, go to the gym to get pumped and always have self confidence.
try telling them how you feel with a card.
men just love to compete.
so many thoughts in the head while sleeping.
tell him that another guy tried to do some things with u and that made u upset
god moves in different ways
well don't sleep with him and wait. hope this helps!
if you look in his eyes you'll see the truth.
obviously you are number one, why would you even ask?
he should experience it for himself.
what is a good present for a woman in whom i am interested who does not yet know it?
i have a preference for hispanic men.
do you have confidence with each other when things are terrible?
if he comes from money, then you should stay with him.
your level of worry is apparent in the way you are spelling words.
if you have a connection with someone, don't worry about the feelings of others.

i don't like saying it, but it gets worse after you're married.
i'm an old fashioned guy.

just ask the guy in an email.
do not crowd her, inform her of your love.
you are a sly one, i was just going to ask this.
can you help me find something unique and not too expensive?
correct, much benefit is derived from resisting sexual activity.
it could never be if you are an adolescent, or around that age range.
that's not the kind of guy you want.
if you like him, then talk to him. it might go somewhere nice.
i heard that's not true.
you're just jealous of other couples because you don't have a man of your own!
he is who he is......
wait to tell him, tell your mom or your school counselor and he can tell your parents
you know you did the right thang
move in and kiss him smack in front of her
do you find them sick or wonderful?

so how would i ask another woman to join us in bed?
you are single and can not find a date.
you should ask a doctor or a person whom you trust.
so, shall i tell my significant other that i do not enjoy his companionship?
initially, become soaked in the rainwater and inform your gentleman friend to transport you and snuggle together.
perhaps she is intentionally making it difficult for you or she is interested but does not want to admit it.
simply inquire if he'd object to your transmittal of those types of photographs.
my initial experience (and final) experience participating in sexual intercourse while viewing television.
stop letting your husband slack on his responsibilities.

i would enjoy it if she pleasures herself in front of me.
you can believe what you want to believe.
why are you wasting time with somebody who doesn't respect you?
most men boys really like to act out on there around pretty girls.
ask him straight, out do you want to marry me
it would look pretty crazy but if you love each other who cares.
in time it will pay off.
my bro ego can't handle a female knowing about it.
he treated me like crap, body and mind.
that just shows that he’s really into you.
he’s the one who doesn’t love you!!!
you think maybe they like each other?
maybe you’ve just met the wrong guys, most are not so dumb.
the wedding is not about you!!
we talk about sex on the phone all the time and we don't ever get tired of it.

perhaps he simply is checking to see how you are doing.
i do not think we will lie to you if you ask him.
i do not like valentines day.
to make the house smell clean and look clean, lose the cat, clean everything and spray for bugs!

so he don't like your kids and you don't like his?
i'd be happier if it was a chess cake
that'll show her that she's important to you and you don't care about your friends.
if it's about love, and you can do it, then it's a good thing.
there's plenty of guys out there.
why can't she see? everyone else can.
he flirted a bunch, but i still don't know.
you should sit them down, let them know that they should be understanding, and support you.

if he doesn't cough up child support, report him to the pigs
don't tell no one
is that qn for men?
talk to her and figure out if she's interested in you or not
if you get excited about men and women you are probably bi.
she is still hot for you from the first time.

help, how do i survive this?
if she wants you butt she is worth depending on.

the feels are the most amazing ever
she needs to open her eyes before it gets ugly
it's easy to see by the way they look at u and talk to you

just think about it...i'd drop his ass.
if you want we can talk about it
ya, if you're a boy
i thought it would never happen, but i got asked out.
if you have to ask questions like that, then you are too young to get married.
when i was married, i was faithful.
no woman will ever fess up to that!
who knows, let it be, and let them alone.
laugh it works wonders
u sure you want to communicate
u can help you by helping each other, tell him and try to understand
one day hopefully the truth will come to lite
before you make a big mistake, have a conversation about this.
there is no better way than to tenderly tell him right away.
you should ask him to join you at dinner or a film.
getting her intoxicated and then kissing her worked for me.
pray for guidance as people will come and go in your life.
have you and your parents hung out?
it's only if they're sick.
i don't want him to
look at his important traits, is he a good person, is he nice?
it's time to be a good friend, ,give him space so he can be alone.
just be yourself, women see thorugh the bs and know when you're fake.
saying yes is the easy part, actually doing it is a whole different story.

people want what they can't have
if you need help. send me more info.

it is better to tell someone news over the phone or in person.
it is not as simple with children.
distance makes it harder to lie.
on top of the covers with the lights off and a few candles lit.
a few days later he dumped me.
love is really liking someone or something alot.
wait because you are too little.
that means you can have it both ways.
if he says no, he's cheating on you.
just go back to your lonely one person sex show
no...are you a guy or girl?
its something to do thats free
if you still have a thing for your ex don't waste anyone news time
my husband and i moved in two weeks ago. you should go for it.
it is the same reason as mine.
some men simply need some additional stimulation to complete the task, so to speak.
you should continue if you like him.
who goes on in mens' heads?
no, he knows that we are not acquainted with one another.
do not allow if if you do not want it, even if he never admits to it.
men do not think with their heads.
a great personality is what makes women happy
when the guy you like likes you to
believe me i know it's a lot to remember
this guy needs to pay for you as well
get drunk and get naked
have intercourse with someone you love.
i would probably not date an adult entertainer.
i do not care for large breasts.
then jon inquired if i would become jealous if spent time with another woman named alyssa.

most of us men have moved on to other topics and aren’t thinking about it anymore.

how can i get out of this?
do you love him?
maybe you shouldn't be worried at all.
not feeling bored, that's what true love is my friend.
why not get a job and then you'll have your own money.
if you make each other happy then, then do what you know.
i simply desire a selection of quality romance tunes to enjoy. i'm aware of the sappiness quotient, however, so what?
you will not come across as being cheep if you do not have sex with him.
what should a person do who is interested in a woman who may or may not also be interested?
the chase is over once they are interested.
that doesn't mean he doesn't love you!
no way, he noticed that!!!
cause most men are horny assholes that cant get laid.
i would like to be your friend, how old are you?
its up to you, don't spend too much time looking.
don't poke at him, he'll let you know when he's ready
well that explains a lot
the money might be good, but there's somethin else goin on there if you know what i mean
if you don't do somethin soon someone else might snatch up the one you love
you can learn from this!!!
should i stay with him or no?
theres a big age gap, so be careful.
i was dying laughing when i read it.
go to a party and talk to people.
because they believe they're well-liked and attractive and they simply possess those qualities in regard to courting.
tell him the worst thing he can say is no.
i want to be respected, and i would like him to be kind.
he is not worth your time anyways!
what do you think?
my friend's crush wants to hang with her
not sure girls will ever know
women feel mature for their age think u should
r u in love w/someone?
i stopped a kid from jaywalking across the street in the rain.
if you want to keep him in check, don't give him what he wants.
it's weird that kids are answering these questions.
you can have sex if you want.
don't let a man control you.
so did he tell you or did you find out on your own?
why would you even want to marry someone on trial for _num_ attempted murders?
it's sad but you gotta face the facts.
she's probably shy because she likes you.
i'll do anything for someone i love but only if they love me too.
have them take a professional lie detector test.
my day also suckss
he can see missed calls, even when the phone is on silent.
get her to go on a dinner date.
in real life it's a bummer
phone sex is an option from the real thing
pick a place to live after you've talked to her
this is totally useless, i bet
she digs different hair colors
this is the time of your life! live!!
how should i know?
you gotta do it for your man.
his mouth is too small and it won't fit
how do you and ya ma.
so how do i break it to them
some people are just freaking stupid
does he care about what you have to come in or no
that is so not right thats ur friend!!!!!!
a good gf has gotta be pretty, polite and have a great body.
its gonna hurt no matter what.
they don't get it because nobody has ever treated them that way.
what are you trying to say because you don't know anything about women.
do you have a profile pic i can see
to begin with let him know you wanna kiss her
sex can hurt whether you're married or not
don't pay attention at the heroin
you think you love him, but leave his sorry ass
some guys have a better looking ass then their face..
look around, can you see all them beautiful girls their everywhere!!!!
we all go to school with the boy ya know _num_, me, and jj
people come up with lots of excuses for not having found "the one"
to me, it seems like he needs to grow up .
she should try a sports bra on.
what can i do??? i have already been nothing but extra nice to her all the time.
you guys are broken up already so now that is his problem.
this is the best way to find your answer.
i agree with gab's observation that there is no way to know.
finally, the muslim question is hilarious.
the upside down kiss in spider-man caught him off guard.
you should not think that way because it can give everyone the impression that you are unintelligent.
do they genuinely love you, or are they simply stating their love without proof?
you know they are merely dreams.
i find a hairy chest and chin to be attractive.
he is ignoring you for the same reason that we ignore you.
do i have to get over my crush?
i proposed to her once by mistake, and she accepted.
what is it was a guy?
it is not the only things that is true.
every man will like different things about a woman.
easy just tell her u need a hug now and then
just dont give it to her
maybe take a break for a bit
_num_ grade was fun thats it
if you have a lot of sex, you tend to fall more in love with someone.
men just really want women who can take care of them, not much else.
we met through his brother.
don't hold back, let it all out.
i guess, but it takes a lot of patience.
it's not necessay, but it helps!
i was like hell yes, totally!
it sounds like he already has a girlfriend.
either way its fine if you are wearing a skirt and heels or just baggy jeans.
he's totally into another girl so just forget about him already.
tell him you don't like him, nicely
my husband has to do his own shit
don't stalk people, or your cray
don't be dumb like me
i get you. i've got the same bag.
man, was grosssss when my chick bit my dick and ate it.
some other chick having lunch with my dude and on valentine's day, that sucks.
fatty fatty eats is what makes the most people kick the bucket.
find her, will happen!!!!!
i wish i know what the right thing to say is.
take her to a vacation resort that means something to her.
just keep it quiet for her.
message me now on yahoo messenger. pao__num_ is my id.
i went through that _num_ years ago.
so you dont love him because u only called him _num_ times?
loads of things are importatn
gots to be good in the boudrwour _num_
there are lots of good guys
you'll find that special someone if you keep looking for them
acceptable or not your partner don't need to know everything you think
it is way more exciting things shy is sucky
heck yeah i used to do it all the freaking time
just casually throw it out there
they are total liars
sex makes everything weird, totally messes with a friendship
get u a girl who shares your interests
you really care about the person, u should give it a shot
any girls got any good advice about doin it first for a virg?
naw, only if your good with your friend watching too
it's hard being _num_, ain't it?
y'all either need to go for counseling or buy a bigger bed!
sex is as necessary as breathing and drink water.
believe me, it can get uncomfortable.
ten years ago they fell in love and have been ever since.
their friends will talk smack about you to their other people.
state and federal grants are free, you don't owe anything for them.
internet ,the wrong place for this.
you dont need no special shoes.
if he wont sit with you, then he's not into you in a romantic way, really.
if he wont lick it then dont let him stick it either.
who broke up with who, huh?
like adam and eve but they were smart.
damn look at the ego on you!
cake is a peice of cake.
nope. get real, what is the free speach centeral.
just do the thyng!
if he's in love with her why not date her?
tell him that either he is the boss or kick his butt to the curb.
if you haven't already gone, get to a doctor asap.
no matter what my pals think, i believe i am one of a kind.
suprist them say i love you
sorry is somehing hes good at saying then month goes by and he lies again
my bf is like a government mule farting and belching
here it is if hes into u for what u do, do something he doesnt like then see
youve got to tell him the truth or youll always wonder
just love em god lovved u _num_
fell to my knees never forget that
jimmy wayne, that awesome country singer, has this song, "baby, baby, stay gone. you gotta give that some ear.
though, i like some heavy petting, even a little bit of stroking it.
first off, don't do it unless you feel like it.
i married a good looking, but rude man that i eventually divorced.
it's only worth it if you guys can both wait.
if you don't let him be, you're gonna be in some serious trouble maybe.
if its truly love its not scary, and if your scared it its not love. you havent met the right guy _num_, wugl
find someone else to be with and get on with your life!!!
imo your mom kicked the wrong one out no offense.
ummmm if its supposed to be special and classy nite, no edible undies for one thing!!!
its not _num_ ok.
don't because she was women they don't like that
yeah but i hope i never have to pleasure.
you sat on the bed and looking at each other and then we kissed.
when it's time to meet the right person you'll meet them trust me.
hey you guys could either get along or not.
i ain't a ugly prude...i like oral sex and porn
the waves don't usually get so big wen its rainin
u don't want to see him again?
no not really, but your baby may be born deformed or retarded
showing her will just cause issues and fights
dont call her back
if she doesnt like you, its her loss
what am i suppose to do with these _num_
was this boss always on his case
look straight into the depths of his soul and you'll find the answer
most men like younger women and i am no exception
if killing himself is the only way to get over it do it
so he tried to commit suicide and my idiotic ass went to see his stupid tail in the hospital
btw, i am not criticizing you or name calling.
don't let sex throw a kink in it.
men are only human and they have feelings too.
women and men are really different.
srsly just stop being lazy
man is man ya know?
most men are, but some are not.
the womenz is jelluss and there iz a reezon for it!
he score no pointz with mee, donot like kitties!
her did do it one tyme, forshame u!
if you into menz and womenz, u is then bi!
i rilee dew like a dud that has a round azz!
if you don't want to marry him, why bother?
i like it doggie style, but different strokes for different folks.
if you like her i guess it's ok.
u need to give the dude more love!
couldn't believe it myself till i check out her eyes.
we been together ever since i was _num_ and that was _num_ months ago.
when u feel horny you should have sex.
i hope the chick doesn't given a damn if i slept around.
he didnt do it to you
have a convo without accusation????
my bf loves me, hope so for u _num_
visit romania thats where im from
do it- get hitched
you hooked up with your boss! cut that
naw he didn't he sad
he's a d-bag but he wants me
if u her friend dont do it
congrats b & g shes a lucky woman
man u too good _num_ her
sex videos can make you a lot of money.
her looks doesn't matter.
the chickens don't even care.
her credit cards weren't working when she tried to use them.
get her some flowers and candies in case she likes romance, it doesn't matter that valentines day has passed.
are you advertising your stupidity?
let's get a little action going here! :)
don't have sex until you are wet or it will hurt like heck!
nah,he just likes talking to you.
if you think this will lead to a break up then just watch what happens.
you don't know her well enough to be in love with her.
i've been there myself.
what would make you think this was ok to do let alone brag about?
i hope it all ends well and you either find a new boyfriend or find you lost love.
uh, yeah, they need some more clothes on
better wrap it twice if you aren't ready to step up and take responsibility
watch out, you are trippin if you let it happen again
there are plenty of fish in the see, don't limit yourself
i believe that women also do it.
not having sexual relations is very beneficial when the woman is grotesque.
you will find the person who you can love.
you will find many sweet meanings when you're in love.
she did that to you?
you should tell her you love her and attempt to find money.
be brave and say it
my yahoo name was oscreamifyoudoitright
so when your bf hasn't called or messaged in _num_ weeks, what do you do?
my wife does this to get my attention.
they aren't happy so something is missing in their relationship
you're my one and only bestie.
it depends own your age.
find some one in jail that will marry you.
i didnt know that until now.
do it when you get married.
your still going to feel like you can't trust men.
women do not speak of it, a lot.
would you like to discuss what is happening?
those moments during which you're unable to remove that individual from your thoughts.
do not go back for him.
gaze into her eyes and smile softly.
she says what she means
i don't believe in horoscopes but i'm a gemini.
all some guys care about is banging.
yeah my ex said it too.
if he just wanted to make out he didn't love you.
does your wife have kids, you didn't say?
he's not that into you.
you can do so much better than that!
you should date around instead of being tied down.
i never want to lay eyes on him again.
you should buy a house far enough so your family only comes once month.
we always know what the other is thinking we dont need to talk
does she know what i want in life?
with love comes marriage and then comes sex
why not get a job and help him out?
i keep thinking about it...was it me?
and what do you do when this relationship blows up?
do not be a whore or talk to much and you will be golden.
i think for me its completely unfair.
it could be love, it is possible after _num_ months.
i possess a pair: you render your own determination.
you don't have a chicken but do you
women are no comparison to men when it comes to this.
_num_ personality _num_ healthy body _num_ kindness
like or love who ever you want.
accept the fact that she doesn't want to date you.
crucify every guy while you're at it!
yeh, get rid of the cat!
you sound hott so that’s good.
first you pick a guy you really like.
why would a man decide not to date a virgin?
my advice is to think deeply about it.
you will never get any peace of mind having him around you.
it was a man, not a boy.
i would like a companion to talk to.
like myself, i am currently in a long distance relationship.
i think being playfully difficult is the best strategy.
to some degree, i prefer to date heavier men.
how bout sending your ex a v-day gift??
it's so worth the effort cuz you're as hot as a chilli!!!
my eyes only see your beauty
sex with ma man. (i got to keep him all to myself!)
tell him you aint ready for all of that marriage stuff and if he keeps askin you gonna have to walk
your daughter needs to come before anything else in this world
there is a perfect partner for every woman
if i can do it, you can do it too
maybe get your bestie to tell him
do any other women feel that way?
if it's really love he'll be able to wait without cheating on ya
you're too young to take life so seriously
they got a hard face
right, get out fast!
true love will fin you anywhere as long as you're honest.
i contemplate sexual activity constantly, and to a greater extent than every male friend.
performed in as off-key a manner as is conceivable inane tunes are the course of action to take!,,
hold you head up and just smile.
they are, at most, five years older than you.
go up to her and tell her that you are her prince charming shes been looking for
there are a ton of better options out there right now
they laughed without regard on certain occasions
it did in my head.
gentlemen fall for all types of girls . all men have different choices
as long as you have a romantic interest in him it is fine .
due to your mental challenges, as my child, you are prohibited from socializing with people of the opposite sex
i'd help but i'm to lazy to read that stuff
the rest is just bullshit
find a person you deserve
been w/a hot dude and its going well
love my ex still
stay away from those plants i told u about
if she thinks ur hot, that'd be awesome
if you like someone else then say so.
it's soooo wrong to discriminate based on sexual orientation.
i don't get it why some people think it's uber pleasurable, it's creeping me out if anything.
anyone that loves you should be sensitive to how you feel.
until the time comes, stop being a hater.
guys love that she's not looking for a comitment.
don't give it disrespect either, k?
are you leading him on?
you need to let it go, and move on.
i am able to tell that all of you girls think differently.
what happened to his queen?
it depends on you.
if it is worth it to you, then i supposed you could try it.
i dont know, do you think you're ready.
are you down for men or women?
go as far as you want to go.
she shouldnt ask me, i have no idea.
why can't you find yourself a job?
i think im in love
i asked him what makes you think im looking at you?
would it bug him if you wanted other guys pics?
must not have been too bad they got married
dude it was soooo long
women are slow to warm up...you can halep with that fi you know how.
when a person is mature enuff to take on marriage, they don't find it necessary to ask thise kinds of qs.
i just can't figure out a way to get along with my moms boyfirend.
i know i'm a sex addict, but haven't figured out if it's a problm or something that will pass.
take my word for it, their favorite position is any one that allows them to hold cash in their hot little hand.
i got offered to stay the night at a girls house that i know.
tell them that they should have asked you earlier as you already have a date.
sstop dreaming and thinking of what could be.
if you do inspire her to impress you, then you do not look the same to her.
when i look back on it, i am not too sure why i did that in the first place!
i am not asking him on a date, no way!!
since you asked, i'll tell you, it is too dangerous.
if you really want to know, then ask her!!
so what if he looks good, if he's rude, whats the use?
ask him if he would like to hang out with you on a date.
this is our only issue; we get along great otherwise.
from where do you obtain these statistics?
if no one that you like asks you for a date, then just refuse.
it probably is discomforting for him.
i got smarts, but i ain't got enough smarts for him.
you ever liked a girl, but not to the degree you want to be in deep with?
what if you do all that, then you break up? that would suck!
i have no idea who you are.
retreat from the situation quickly and do not look back.
i heard some people say that if were to ask god for forgiveness for loving the opposite sex, then, you will be able to enter into heaven in the afterlife.
i care for him as a very good friend.
learn how to spell because i cannot understand your question.
i suggest you refrain from doing something you would regret at a later date.
hes talking to _num_ else so you aint gonna tell u.
that made me start drinkin and smokin
what are youre feelings? it aint gonna matter if you agree with him.
get it as thick as u want it.
go for young hot guys forget the handsome older dudes.
what's the opposite of being above someone?
dudes aren't into that.
just ask her out man!
no matter what everyone else things, she's the girl i love the most.
what about a pajama party?
do you like causing other people to hurt?
my bestie gives me crap about the way i am.
i've been there, just move on.
most guys dream about the same things.
its not a good idea to be dating everyone.
karma will punch him in the face.
dont let him see you at your worst.
but, we are very happy as we are enjoying life!
don't be stupid! just go out with him this one time, and if you enjoy yourself then stay with him.
why do the more exciting sports have lots of physical contact?
you should not obtain another dog for him.
you should love the person you are having sexual relations with.
it is better to loose a lover then like someone with no ambition.
you love your wife if you are asking this question.
dont change urself if you want a guy look want you just so he thinks youll be a good gf
my boobs are way too huge for this top
check the q&a section, i usedta be friends with my new girl, then dumped 'er
he doesn't get it, i love him, but im just his friend
best thing a dude can do in life is sex, it feels good as hell
he did it in their house, right under angelina's nose, crazy!
if a black man breaks into my home should i just assume all black people are robbers?
was he not attracted to me that night?
wear a hot dress, make yourself really pretty, cook a great meal and then have hours of crazy sex.
a chick likes a real dude
yeah take a look at that comment says volumes!!!!
if he called it was _num_ a week
its cool for woman to be into woman some dig it others move on
i am cuz if i wasnt' than id wit a girl, lmfao.
ok, this ones for the ladies mostly: have you ever gone with a a guy you didn't really know well>
sure, if you reallly need too than send one to him to.
i think it just makes it easy and quick access.
well, ladys dont care about it as much as men do anyhow.
or simply enthused regarding their romantic relationship?
i recommend handing them a toilet brush.
there is no need to keep playing immature games.
that is not typical for a man.
i would probably break up with him for that.
in my singular opinion, i do not prefer artificial breasts.
what a tangled web we weave, when first, we practice to deceive.
i do not understand why you are confused. the man wanted you for sexual reasons.
don't provide him with many opportunities.
i am merely curious. thank you for answering.
i don't see anything wrong with the two of you not wanting to have intercourse.
become akin to wild animals. have intercourse at any location.
i believe that will happen, why not?
or do you actually love me?
are you not answering your own questions?
i dont think flirting and acting stupid are at all the same thing
go for it, because you get one shot
i begin by complementing what they have on
he was like thinking that i was having a good time
girls show their feelings better than guys do
move on w/ur life & let her go to live hers
love always finds a way. if youre ment to b together, u will.
dont let him hurt you again, for real.
i kno u can, but do u mean it fur real?
women like a challenge when they look fr a man, not just _num_ they can boss around.
just watch what he does.
i cant think about seeing someone else since we broke up.
the holy grail...wish i could help.
be safe, wear a rubber.
remember it's up to you, dont do anything that you dont want to do.
it’s not realy a bad thing.
don’t let him get ya down.
forgive and forget only when you have to
if he doesn’t care about you, it will show.
every man does it.
recently, he started avoiding me and won't even say anything to me.
kids don't like divorce
you should do a good deed each day
look for someone who is your own age and you have similar interests
i just want to be friends with women, said no guy ever!
it depends on the both of you.
you sound very sorry, so you should.
what matters is how long and how thick.
im in my mid _num_ and im still a virgin
if it aint important why she datin another girl
you should give him a chance to get to know ur kids
if their in love they should be livin _num_
yep, u sure can.....did u miss that part of sex ed?
believe this, people ain't always who they appear to be.
when you want to love up on him every time you see him
when you hear that love song, you only think about them
he don't trust me?
don't worry about that
it will change when you are older.
he will find another, but you seem to want something more.
you can always try to invest in stocks and bonds.
from your statement it would appear that you are merely holding onto a dream. dr. checko (which is a nickname).
tell the truth and deal with the consequences.
i think stupid exceeds those who make bad decisions.
skin color shouldn't matter
you should tell her to wait.
he still wants to be only friends.
if you become involved with a mess, you will find yourself embroiled in a mess.
you need to make him believe you have interest in his best friend.
they seem to be a better friend now.
this shouldn't be done via email
if i get dumped for this reason then i deserve it.
she's gotta listen and find out what happens
gotta say "let"s stop"
give her some time to change her mind, use the power of suggestion.
you crazy girls seem to panic over every little thing.
tell him you've made up your mind and are not changing it.
i found out after matt and i got together that the feelings between me and jon were mutual.
men do it for the same reason.
if you dress like you've got sense, you will find a good man.
she is going to find out that we were knocking boots with one another
that is a dumb question. if you don't know, then you won't ever know.
yes, you love him, but do you want to risk him receiving a sexually transmitted disease and giving it to you?
i need many answers so please attempt this.
it should not matter what his butt is like if the man treats you well.
they no longer want to be your friend, correct?
they are a large part of your life.
some men are made uneasy by marriage and other commitments, and a discussion might be effective.
most married men are happy.
tell her you and mom both lover her but dont want to live with each other right now
tell that bastard you went to the clinic, and now your infected by him
just say hello and have a regular convo
i asked how he felt about me and he said he didnt like me anymore
just follow your heart and do what you want to do
uhhh, no he doesn't really know her, they've only talked online...
that is not normal...
don't force it, you might make a mistake.
if he doesn't like her, she should just move on!
no one will like it.
you've got someone to share the good and the bad with.
either wait for her to email u back, or talk to her in _num_
the flowers might be too much.
you two should bang as often as you can. .
then u know it already.
if you wait you'll get the goodies
if a girl trust u and loves u she shouldn't hold your past against u
i would say a three-way is cool if all togther, but otherwise totally uncool
it's usually the one that sucks in bed
don't try to make an impression; just let her know you like her.
i lost my virginity at _num_ and i really didn't understand all the hype.
do you use yahoo chat rooms?
if you like his friend better, just tell him.
i don't like skinny supermodel types.
i just want to know why men cheat
tell me exactly what men want from women
why do people risk so much of their lives for sex
i'm still stunned by the way some people behave it's sad.
if you wait to long most girls are going to find it weird
is the one that you have causing you grief?
are you guys gonna include me in the convo, or what?
have a party with your gfs and then she can met new peeps.
it's not bad if you are _num_ and he is _num_
screwing and get your man's attention is all about the food and sex.
you can find a pretty blonde but she won't have brains.
ask and you might get an answer.
did you fall in love with her personality?
you'll regret it later on, mark my words
just stop wasting time, and talk to him!
the leading cause of divorce is getting married.
you know what he is doing, but you do not care, because you allow him to lie.
you are unaware of his true age?
yes, you can fall in love after four months because i did.
just say that you respect yourself.
there's a girl at my school that i like.
at night do you dream about her?
if that isn't working, just talk to a friend.
i don't chat with other dudes.
that is a very good way to begin the day.
it would be enjoyable to have a picnic lunch in a beautiful, quiet and private setting.
where does he work, how many hours does he work, ask those questions.
you know, we do it as well.
i have been there.
ask her if it's okay if you aren't sure.
i am a virgin and would love to find a virgin girl too.
don't talk too much.
well a tolerable personality then?
don't worry youll grow out of it.
they are definitely addicted to cumming
i don't want anything to happen to her.
you can follow someone around if you want.
if you fancy the man, vocalize the affirmative. if you're not romantically interested, respond in the negative.
the world is full of men.
find someone new, because you would not have gotten married.
you need to sign another one with each other every day.
everyone can watch my girl strip! im a mac daddy!
don't sweat the small stuff.
except if it was good dream.
i do not have to be a certain religion to attend a wedding.
save your broken heart, and find someone who will treat your heart right.
you do not need to have all women like you, only one.
the flirting most likely led you to believe that he wanted more.
request her contact details. if she fails to provide them, the obvious conclusion is she has no affection directed at yourself.
for me, it is a woman being mature.
break up with him. you loving him does not mean he feels the same.
that really is not any of your business.
but, i have my own ideas and opinions as well.
the abbreviation lol stands for laughing out loud.
would you say it is acceptable for me to have sex with my girlfriend?
you never know what might help. try flirting with women.
don't let another girl get in good with your crush.
he says he just kidding as he throws a banana at the screen while scratching his head.
even if she'd just been with him, i'd hit on her.
do the right thing and listen to your heart.
ask her to hang out casually.
when ur in jail there cant be a wedding. obviously.
say hi first and go from there
how are they different from you??? quit saying there dumb and ugly cause there not.
i love my sister, but she has shitty relationships.
you've goto go to iraq, but stay in touch.
i say that u should stand on a chair, or use stilts.
nah, he just likes to change girlfriends sometimes.
u'r the _num_ person i really love.
people don't even go there!
anyone taste the milk before buying the cow?
that sounds like something on tv!
i think their husbands are not good enough.
iiin that case, i think it is nothing to worry about.
if you love someone, then it is for their personality, not their race.
i quit and joined the rec team, it was much more enjoyable.
the issue with women is that, the ones that have poor body hygiene, think that they do not.
we aren't getting any younger, but that is the adventure of life!
i always call him out on it, when i catch him looking at another woman, but of course he denies it.
amen! but i gotta do it anyway, or she be crazy af!
don't get mixed up in their drama, whatever you do.
the only way this will work is if y'all are best buds.
what do i say so that i don't scare her?
sure, but you have to be eighteen or over.
if you hang out with your old friends, you'll find new friends.
the people who don't get it are clearly brainwashed.
i don't fin it sexy, personally.
all i know is that i agree!
if u dont know im not telling u
im a dude and i know what u should do
that song sex and candy is good
maybe she feels the same
im pretty sure he doesn't trust you
sorry no, you need to get a job
why bother? its just a piece of paper
if you want my advice no don't do it
be honest with yourself and don't let anybody use you especially him
this sounds weird but you should try both gay and straight porn.
woman married a dolphin nothing is impossible now at all ever.
whatever is meant to be will be so you should just be honest and confident.
i feel sexy when men hit on me
your behavior sucks so you need to change that and behave.
it sounds like he is a cheater.
i dont let my girl wait on me.
i'm the love of his life so he would never even think to cheat on me.
i tell my man that i love him all the time.
do you want to come and sit in my cockpit?
i like it when they lights are on and the woman is on top.
she may have left you just for your personality.
i can't believe he is talking to you.
the most important consideration is to enjoy yourself.
they aren't playing sex games.
sex? of course! can't get enough of it!
i love talking to him, makes me sick to my stomach when i can't.
welcome to crazy town, we are the royal family!
that is great; i still have a long way to go.
you can find someone better.
men like a little mystery in a woman, but not too much.
i am happy i have her as my wife.
however, that is not a bad thing if you are with someone responsible and you enjoy it.
you will get married as soon as you decide you want to.
just write him a note.
it does not matter your age, you should run anyway.
just tell him about the call
honesty is the best policy try it
he didn't care what you thought
it just blows now, but give it time and you'll get over his ass
ive been hitched twice and got two sons out of it
he marrying a woman, yeah?
you just gotta nice ask her why she has talked to you for a while
youve been hanging with some trashy women
what do you do if he's appealingly attractive?
if you do not tell her, she will believe you are hiding something.
that's untrue. if you truly are in love, your relationship will remain strong, no matter what occurs.
alternatively, you could spread rumors about her, from where ever you happen to be.
she accomplishes it once more, feel ashamed.
you are taking the right course of action. divorce him and continue with your life.
then go ahead and ask her out.
i cannot play with him for very long because we have three children under five years old.
they have dieases, so they are not good to have around babies.
everyone is self conscious about some part of their appearance.
you aren't asking anything really.
life is great, that's all you need to know!
if i don't have anything better to do.
where's your place at?
maybe he doesn't want to talk to you.
yyou will feel younger if you have young friends.
surprise her with it, then bequeath presents during supper.
get a bf thats also ur off
he needs to take care of the baby
you get what you pay for
he wants to fuck you still
totally cool people are attachted to other people
my grams tells this story better than _num_
dudes think about sex way more than chicks
just say you were thinking bout it
you should give it time and just see how things go.
the end didn't go well.
what do you want to do?
people don't give a crap about strangers.
no matter how you feel get over it and go to the wedding.
my best friend is a man. we have never attempted to take it further.
you should be angry about this.
i suggest asking them when they are taking a lie detector test.
it did not, in my case.
you will not discover love on the internet.
ask the girl to go with you to the dance.
you can do so many things.
stop holding back, go after him!
mess around with his friend?
why are you so sweaty?
if you're shy, make him close his eyes
if he's so stuck up, he doesn't deserve you
you have got to take a stand about this
that question is a waste of time
your _num_ year old has a dad already
nineteen, almost twenty years old. how old are you?
a woman should like you for you.
travel to henderson, north carolina. a sufficient amount of that group exists in this location.
if you are already sexually active with the man in any case then the best choice is to have sex.
we are not mind readers.
some people just need the right motivation.
if that doesn’t work, don’t know what else to tell u.
she was messing around when u guys were still together.
if she like to go to the beach, maybe a weekend in the bahamas!!
it'll happen fo sho... if you really love her!
you don't know her style so you should buy a woman clothes unless she picks them
don't rush... be patient
make sure it’s almost perfect and take your time.
u won’t win if u play games like that.
u will definitely like it.
jon and i used to talk all the time and we were super close.
she really might not to be with u anymore. ask for the truth.
tell your mom and pop you love em and git on wit things
sorry man, i got no clue where he at
since i've had so many dogs i know they are part of the family.
how can i explain to her that she needs to shed some pounds
that place is chock full of knowledge
don't let anybody tell you differently.
yes, his butt is important in rating how hot a guy is.
it's a simple way to say he only wants a booty call.
i could never hurt somebody i cared about.
i am thinking it's a mixed bag.
ssome guy might ask why women are very promiscuious.
do not run; but, tell him to slow down.
in that case, what ought i do for her?
ik'm aware. i stated that previously.
he wouldn't care if he did know!
you can toss her in the ocean on the cruise
it is what it is.
whoever is holding the treasure is getting played.
i can't ever find him
she's messin' with you,thats what my neighbors thinking.
i've never had sex with a guy who wasn't hot.
make her do it because not wearing a bra is unattractive.
just give him a call and ask.
i've been with a few bisexual girls. it's a big turn on.
don't be so possessive and give him some space, guys like that.
i dig italian girls.
you get _num_ points for that answer!
if they don't work out, keep your head up and keep going!
act like you care and listen if he brings it up.
stupid people, stupid people everywhere!
i am saying this as your friend.
he can't date a girl in junior high school, that would be a major problem.
totally wrong on that problem
no way dude don't date someone you don't even know
don't go back on your first thing, stick with the first one
that is not bad at all.,
however if you feel amenable to it then it should be acceptable,
if he is doing it voluntarily, he should be questions and closely watched.
men don't fear the word 'love'.
they have left us no choice but to separate, but i will never stop loving him...
head where your instincts lead you, even if it is in the wrong direction.
it was terrible, having sex with a undersized man.
why did you enjoy the experience?
for a good time, we went to certain clubs.
i have heard about friends who start dating and find out that they were meant to be.
i can help you if you have questions about boys
phone sex is the best!!!!!
reading people is a skill you really need to have
go buy something that would knock him off his feet
ur luvin sucked them in
me + him = friends
i hope it'll be good
men aren't babies, they don't need women to act like thier mothers.
don't get too riled when he puts you down...if he's not a good match, you'll know it soon enough.
my guy thinks i am and that's all that counts.
ya'll know alot about each other already.
i can't explain why, but i felt that way about a lady once.
just act like he isn't here.
if you are thinking about taking him back, you better think again! don't do it!
you don't know the threat you pose!
dont use words, just communicate with those eyes
im into a great kisser, but great sex rules too
youre head is just messed up right now, u dont know what u want
you are who it depends on, is it something you want to occur?
the man will marry the woman if she has not had sex with too many other men
there's got to be something in the water
what kind of friend are you interested in finding during your quest
nah, maybe he wants to hear you talk before he goes to sleep
it is probably the one thing that is more important than good health for humans.
they are only using you.
you will own him by having sex.
having sexual intercourse is like business, while the process of making love is more fun.
all of that is true. i become that way occasionally.
some guys just can't remember when they are around hot women like me.
women always discuss it when they get together.
maybe you don't like bad boys?
you could probably do way better.
when you see her, make sure she sees how great you really are.
i know i'd want my daugher to be gay because i know how guys are.
they're not worth thinking about.
so how do i tell him i'm having his kid without making him blow up?
start by kissing and move on from there.
it might depend on the girl. i lie a lot, and people believe me.
i would't be concerned regarding the embarrassment quotient that's present.
touch her privates with your nose.
i''m aware of a female who was wedded to an abusive lowlife and he physically abused her children.
iff you are that upset, you should find soemone new.
if he gets you then give it a shot
i'd stay friends he seems cool
i dont know them
how would you feel if your husband cheated on you someday
smiles are free and charming
someone will find u anyways
don't waste your time apologizing. you lost him. that was your decision. so beat it.
then i guess i'm like your gf and ur like my hubby.
they love each other so much and they have hope
umm, i'm not on the list?!
you know whether you can trust your man; if so, do not worry.
i can't find any reason.
guys can be attractive, cool, and weigh over two hundred and fifty pounds.
do you thing i should go back there, or should i stay home?
why is he your boyfriend?
i have gained _num_ pounds.
it is something that might lead to love.
i really look for a married man.
now i am twenty-eight years old and single.
if you want to be with him forever, get married.
she probably will, but there is a small chance she won't
he makes you aroused every day, you should thank him and be impressed.
i guess it depends if you believe the books that say dreams have meaning.
i'll take a wild guess and guess you'll move to nz?
what are you gonna do while i eat chocolate and look at my roses?
i didn't know what that word ment when i first saw it but my friend told me
it's been forever since he's been in a relationship
i don't know why i spent so much of my life on such garbage like you!!!!!
yes, as long as she is not their supervisor.
yes there are some who are way out there!
yes i can hardly wait so that can undo the same to her.
does it make someone unattractive if they are not asked out on a date?
mmarriage is not something to joke about.
he doesn't love you for you so you need to move on so you can stop being miserable.
do a sexy little lap dance for him.
i's do things to you i wouldnt do to a cookie
would you guys lie about being _num_? is that so old lol.
do not hide!! you could lose them if you do.
chill out, give it time.
if you want to do it without being stopped by a kid, don't have kids
if he did it he wouldn't have strayed
she probs still lives with the rents
y does it even matter dude????
first of all, you can't help your dreams, and fantasizing is just a fantasy.
in addition, it make speople more jealous and anxious so watch out for that also.
there is no way i would post personal information like that.
you can not please another human being. just be yourself.
if you doubt him your gut's usually right
so he doesn't legit have a reason to hate you?
now i'm curious what was that about?!?
ever happen to you?
if he likes you then go with him!
tell her to tell him you like him.
it ain't over til it's over!
no - you gotta be smart.
you're better now than when u met her.
don't tell him you wanna get wit his sister.
look like a female and actually look
been knowin him since i was _num_- my birthday is next month. _num_! ahhhhhhhhhh! gonna light it up!
cruise with him see what he like
acctually falling in love is very nice, until you become aware of reality.
im very busy, so i am unable to respond.
they could not stay away from eachother for long.
why don't you give her a telephone card, or send her a valentine's card?
enquire as to the direction he envisions his life traveling.
begin to get to know her more
i started to like somebody i hadn't liked before when they asked me out so just ask.
i can tell by how we talk and flirt that she likes me.
i don't want to be a burden.
but don't forget that dating is not the same as a relationship.
not about every guy just one guy.
sense of humor matters most.
repeat this you lying filthy face!
never do stuff in private.
if you feel for a guy tell the man already.
we all just wanna be loved
you get a new one and it won't matter anymore what he thinks!!!!
some peeps get a kick out of that pain/pleazure thang, gets em off
just tell them...it's the only way!!
be preserved with help from god an d you soldiers!!
forgiving them is the only option at this time!!
cheaters always cheat no matter who they are with.
just tell that witch you hate her and she needs to step back
i don't care what she was, only what she is
you gotta understand that mom and dad are happier separated
naw you're wrong, you're just more attractive to him after your dad goes to sleep - hah!
i know it sucks sometimes, but it'll happen when it's s'posed to
am i marriage material?
just stay with both and see where it goes just be careful!
if he wants to be friends then alright thats what it is
you're lways in a good mood
marriage is not easy but its the best
gay guys love to listen to him.
start kissing her on the cheek and she may finish the rest.
if he doesn't give you the time of the day then screw him.
if you love someone then you are giving up being with others.
you do you, don't focus your life on her.
where does she like to eat?
girls should attack first!
just ask him take a bath together.
don’t worry about a serious relationship, just have fun!
it was kinda stupid, but too late to worry bout it now.
if u love 'em u don't want nething else.
if my man strayed, i'd go lorana bobbit on his junk and hang it in the 'stang's rearviw!
loving a dude makes you act so effin strange.
don't give up you're spirit for nobody.
i have a great life! so much to live for!
just open it and ask
tell him you love him. it doesn't matter how. just tell him
just pretend you're interested in another way
my boyfriend is always watching women, while he's driving. he attempts to not be obvious.
treat him as if you would treat a friend you haven't seen for some time.
would you engage in intercourse with multiple people
that guy is misleading you.
i want to be with both when i think about it
dream about me and then ask me out
what traits do you like in women?
i dig him, and he digs me too!
i loved this guy, but when he humiliated in front of _num_ people, i don't know how i feel about him.
you need to dump him, then he'll know that he had someone good.
if it feels right to you, then go for it.
did i tell you lately that i love you?
idk how i will stop thinking bout it.
i would rather have someone to speak to
it's been good and bad.
if you are okay with being her second choice it shouldn't matter.
if you aren't careful you can get preggers.
maybe you need someone for just yourself.
is it far away?
it'll probably wind up as sex if you're in bed together and naked.
when its good with him you'll know
dont try to lord over her
my man says it gives him the chance to tell me he like the way i be looking
have you thought about how that makes you look in front of his homies?
it dont matter what she does, even if she a dancer on the pole she could be a good woman
they should get married now
the guy you think you're dating, ya ain't.
i love myself, and that's why im the only person i worry about.
is there anything the matter?
just so you know, if the men knew what you said no one would like you.
tell him everything that's important
careful in case he's the kind of person who doesn't get things
there has to be a higher sense of humor, confidence and kindness.
i wouldn't want to be the seventh guy if she's thinking about the eighth
he's really sweet but has something wrong with his thinking
can pick me but being more clear about what u want is important too
why does she want _num_ b a spectator?
i don't like hurting people.
she should get credit for not giving up even when she is mad.
my boyfriend that i've been with for a year has always lied to me.
was that on purpose by him?
you can trust if because you would know if we weren't telling the truth.
ask her why she's dating, and how she feels about you.
because they like to make you feel bad.
the answer to your question is that men are confusing.
i love my boyfriend. he is such a good dad to our son!
i guess you're going to sleep with him?
they should try to respect us a little more.
that ticked me off big time.
is this what you are supposed to sign.
it's narrow minded to think god cares about sexual proclivities.
the wedding in the yard was plenty.
people be illin, but i'm glad i married him
trust your gut, if it says go, go, listen to your heart
they cheat once, they will cheat again.
hold on to you hear what she say.
maybe he believes that it is your fault that you are a parent.
i do not want to offend any good men in the world.
i am unaware of that specifically.
do not encourage your girlfriend to become an exotic dancer.
my bff went out wit a short guy and they kissed.
if he says yes, he ain't cheating.
she luvs you like a sis.
why would i snoop if i did?
lonely is something he is not
nah, your the girl of my dreams
break if off with that loser
the job can be done with a coat vacuum ive heard
he does not love you so break it off and dont listen to any excuses
you just see what she looks like and thats it.
u'll never talk to him if you don't just do it now.
being good all the time can get boring, naughty can be fun too.
we have hormones too, fyi!
nah, unless you feel like that might not be right.
babe, i love you so much!!
there are more important things in life the trying to understand men!!
please settle down and relax a lil bit.
sometimes i travel across the country to my hometown toget away.
sex before bed is the best.,
if u like him, say yes and if u don't say noooo!
i'd chose black men cuz white man are just not for me
it depends on the type of game he likes.. war, sports, etc..
i don't wanna be with him anymore
they are loved cuz they found it.
i played over half the game because they coaches were more laid back.
their way of thinking is merely different from yours.
it can help your relationship.
keep playing the game untill you get to level _num_
maybe i can help since i speak the language of idiots, grunts, and jabberwockys.
you can travel to the uk and find the answer.
most of the woman on campus really don't like him.
men like to stare at our breasts.
break up with the girlfriend you have. she would be shocked.
speak up for yourself.
ask her after you give her something nice.
how can i answer that if i don't know if your a dude or a girl?
don't fret and be a jerk about it, cuz love isn't special.
she should hurry up and choose, so she can stop from getting pregnant
if he is cheating, then you need to make him leave.
begin from your wedding day.
i have many male friends, but also many female friends.
the future is not bright.
if you are worried about the lack of commitment, have a conversation about it first.
yeah not gonna wear flats to please some dude
hell get over it even if he loves you
he was quiet when u married him think he would just talk more after?
its all over the internets
dont sleep with them if u havent already
what kind of dad is tat
go for the rough dude
have no idea if hes into me
weak people annoy me
the saying means you are like a brother to her.
that only happens in terrible teenage movies.
he wasn't feeling her like that enough for him to leave his wife.
if you have to, stay with your sister.
i found that it is best to go out with a friend.
do you think that he is interested in me or is just playing games?
i don't like the language they are using.
i do not know how to deny someone and still be friends with them.
some like to snuggle, some don't
i invited her to my rood, we went inside and i shut the door.
romantic love is fun.
have you seen the motion picture 'the game?'
be sure not to profess your love too early in the relationship.
i wanna be done w work!
it takes forever to remember the good stuff and forget the bad stuff.
they were pretty darn good when i saw them last year
you _num_ want a serious relationship even tho she’s not in college yet??
if u can’t do that, then u can email him
think about heer all the time and you'll go crazy about her
sex is on my mind at certain times
it need to be an extravacant public display of how much you love her.. get it!!
oh my god that makes it so aweful!!!!
when you got married you thought it was a fairytail when in reality it might of been a nightmare.
friends will be there to help you if someone hurts you.
tell her to go ask him out.
i think he's seeing a tramp.
if she can't be with just you, let her go.
if you like him, go out with him!
she can't stop you from seeing your child.
no way would a reall ass man, bribe you to kill your child!
i wouldn't call at all, and see what happens.
you should really control your kid, sometimes a smack on the butt is needed.
well, maybe the same way you just told us!
i feel like i could even die to keep my love that is... if it weren't for my kids.
men seem to just want an asian girl and i dont get it why is that?
let me know what to do i need help.
you want to show her? take her friend out on an exepensive date & post pix of u together.
tell her to lay off those bad men!
many of my friends gfs asked the same thing
i'm dealing with that myself
try giving him a kiss to see if you feel anything
my bf loves my toes
you need to do it before he leaves ot when you see him next.
i am a man and recommend that you proceed slowly and steadily.
are you listening to yourself?
lead him to it by tellling him what you want.
every girl hes got will not share?!
i see ya get so bored with him and her both.
you know what to do next!
magic _num_ ball says no way
awhile back we talked and i told him how i felt
she asked me how i felt
it depends how long have you been together?
if you knew you might have tried
you are in trouble.
when she is free and has the desire to do so, she will.
that shouldn't be a problem.
the gown and the bridesmaids' dresses could take you a month to choose on their own!
later on in the zodiac, things got moving along.
a masculine don't have more rights about this, just cuz' he's a man.
jamookae, hez got more issues then time magazine.
i'm thinking about our next kiss
just saying what i think
im not like them.
why would anyone kill an innocent little baby?
you're just not her type.
relax, take a deep breath, and tell her you like her.
if it's meant to be, it'll all work out.
if you don't see a change in _num_ weeks repeat step _num_
most of the time he's not comfortable in the outfits you like on him.
he did me wrong, but i still love him. i don't know what i should do?
don't forget, a man merely being aware of your involvement is no indicator that he won't still make an attempt.
roses have a singularly reddish hue, violets sport a bluish coloring.
do what you have to do because it is not wrong.
his wife may be less seductive now than she has been in the past.
yes, i care, but it is not the most important aspect.
he'll understand so no worries
you run off with the person you cant be without
you need to move on because there are plenty of singles out there
you kinda have to od to feel anything at all
if someone used sex toys and didn't like using them then it didn't really help them
sorry but it will always be awkward and a bit weird.
so um...how does it come out?
if i know her, i'd help.
i don't cheat or fake feelings, but i'm honest
i ain't a teacher, but i like them.
i have glasses and i have boyfriends.
if i find the girl of my dreams i'm set
yeah after he cheated
don't stoop to that level... married men aint worth it
'sok if i dream about different men
it can happen in the right place at the right time.
_num_ isn't really an age when people tend to get fat.
just be strong and tell him you're done with it.
so much can go wrong because you are young.
he got what he wanted and then tossed you aside.
pet stores and barns thats where to look
if ur off on someone new let him go
if i knew id be w/u
dont know you to be in love w/u
its over u missed your chance
she too busy with ol dude to even notice if someone likes her
so you claim to be straight, but are attracted to lesbians,, that makes no sence at all!
we''ll talk later about it.
dont tell him what you like, show him!
most guys will like a chance to get at you, but you're married so...
if ur under _num_ u have a big problem.
maebi that's just hu he is.
i love sex too and can't get enough of it.
go out with him once and if u liked that date then duh stay with him
ask her politely why u havent' heard from her for years.
one get divorced...duh two, prove other lady is a stupid ho, then ur done...
the position they like the best is walking upright in the shopping mall with your money!!
!, and heelll nooo, it's not wrong, do what you gotta do
you can have full intercourse... if you want....
she sees you more as a friend, nothing more
yes it is the french that everyone was using...but this also works...
but remember that dating doesnt have to mean being boyfriend girlfriend.
everyone wants the perfect guy but no one seems to be willing to be one.
just act as if she is one of your friends
if he says bye to you, he was not meant to be.
but women doesnt care it so much like mens do anyway.
but i am with this other girl and i already met her parents and they really like me.
if i knew, i'd be in front of you!
just talk to him, stop wasting time!!
if being apart makes them happy then you should be happy for them
what would be a good gift for a girl i like but she doesnt know
trust me u'll get asked out soon enough.
don't do something you would regret later.
let him be, he's not for you, he's giving you bad advice.
sorry about that... don't fall for it again... save yourself the hurt
is it a real life situation, no i don't think anything happened
well that too in the same house where he is living right now...under angelina's nose!........cool huh?
sounds a little fishy to me...think she's got something to hide??
where a sexy outfit get yourself all pretty make him his fave dinner and then give him sex.
sometimes you can't go home again afterall
just make sure that you are not going overboard with it.
its defenetely oxygen.without oxygen u cant live a single momment .hey nice question aurora....
girls esp--- have u ever gone out with a guy u liked but dint really know?
oh, and do take some time to learn to use chop sticks if you already havn't.
depends if ur a guy or a girl lol
somewhere inside yourself you are strong and that will make him weak!
make her think you don't even think about her at all.
if you're already having sex with the guy anyway... best thing to do is have sex.
i can lend you a few!!
start by kissing, then start to do a little more.
both of you need freedom from the relationship to bring closure & move on.
you shoud tell her how you feel
i'd only get upset if the guy staring is ugly!
why does she want to look?
we are bad liers because ya'll men beat us to it.
people have gotten married in jail.
shall we say, put urself in there shoes.
and they will always be that way!
i got a labrador n luv him a lot!).
dreams don't mean it's going to happen.
boy, what an eye opener for me.
though it's not true, and so if she lies it's only about boys and liking her.
you don't actually have to ask her to be your girlfriend.
she likes u like a bother
only _num_, the first and the last
just keep trying to find that special some one.
is it too far for u?
well, that's how i see it anyway....
they got to be in the mood for love and let it all go!!!
but dont let it bother you.
what about trust when things get tough?
have someone else tell him for you.
roses are red, violets are blue.
if you like him say yes if you dont say no
we have hormones too, you know!
lol do ya get it now?
we're both _num_ kinda low on the budget..and he likes chocolates..but isn't chocs too corny or sumthin?
hmmm.....if u dont know then i wont tell you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sounds like he might have found another way to please himself
if it hurts then its to long

ask him where does he see his life going?
try wallstreet :))..i mean stocks and all...
you never have to ask... look him in the eyes..see to his heart and soul and you will know...
touching is so important...it has no language barriers...and carries so much warmth that it can lift a persons spirit.
then jon asked me if id be jealous if he went out with this one girl *alyssa.
how can i get paid through the internet?
it hinders u from doing fun thigns with people.
dont worry you should grow up and out of that
better question... why is he your boyfriend?
depends on the size of the penis
i want to try and spice things up.
yeah... if i was trying to get out of the relationship
be loyaly and nice and friendly and sweet!
your story is like in tv series.
who the fuck can i answer if i don't even know if u are a boy or girl.
we all control our own lives and unfortunately we don't practice that enough...we look outward for the answers.
try raising yourself.. he is not oblige to feed you!!
and then if you havent already, get you to a doctor!
he will get jealous and when he does tell him that you dont like how he does that too!
_num_@hotmail.com add me and we talk this subject later
it's cool that you like this girl.
so they'll know how many guests to expect...respondez sil vous plez.. french for please respond =p
what the hell does that mean?
then don't go back for him.
it did in my head lol.
i dunno how il get over him.
that only works in bad teen movies!
who is more important to you??
arent u answering ur own q
and by all means--don't do it during your periods b/c that's just nasty.
if he won't sit with you, then you know it's just friendship.
we have had lots of in & outs.
i feel like we have so much time together to now break up would be stupid.
how im gonna handle to stop being a jealous girlfriend?
what goes on in mens head???
i need ur help with this and i guess u need a guys prespective to right?
but if you hve to ask then you already know.
would you date a girl who was a stripper?
u'll see it's much more better
send a video of yourself having sex, it pays
why don't u just tell her the truth?
it isnt a sin = ) and you can go as far as you want.
drop me an email...and if you live close enough i will take you out :-)
dump him hes oviously not interested
ask him to hang out with you, then start moving in on him and see how he responds.
need alot of answers so shoot
sex with my hunk ( i didn't have to share him)
that you are the one and only..
unless your best friend is suggesting this to you i say no way.
hey broo if you're not live in miami area you better get your ass here this is the best........
call her and tell her how much you love her
this guy and i got really close this past few weeks.
are you sending him the wrong message?
just don't tell them u are a virgin.
i luv not having _num_ worry about n e body but myself.
i dont like big tits! )
thats kool dude.. i still have a long way to go.. but thanks for this _num_ points.=d
that's one of the things love's all about....honesty
when he knows im not looking he will stare at a woman and check them out.
i would probably break up with him.
woman wants some challenge, not just a guy she can walk all over him.
is because nobody has done it to then so they dont know how it feels.
we are better liers than guys are...
don't you have guys you like that you don't date?
if your not hiding things, showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
my problem is, i always see others as the way i want to see them...
to get over him just play with guys
“i know he’s a jerk but he says he wants to be with me.”
dump him...your wasting your time if you stay with him
if a guy/gal can't be honest with you then forget him/her!!!!
it's just gonna remain a mystery to all!!
?i promise i won't bring my friends along!...
she knew i was there & i love her.
otherwise if you slowly appproach...her body language will let you know
it doesnt mean he doesnt love you.
crushing on a guy, and knowing he likes me too?
ya the dark hair, dark eyes, and skin...they are rumored to have nice butts too!
either he's really super busy or he's a putzs!
hang out with him a couple times and see what he is like
the waves in boracay normally dont get that big eventhough its raining...
they are just dreams you know.
and am i always going to have to struggle to make ends meet.
take it slow and you try to make it perfect.
because there head is not on their shoulders!
no, i know jim he is.
don't ya love it when a man does that s-hit?
a dinner date in a cruise, so sweet!
if u really like him and know hes the one.dont just do it cause your horny.
if that doesn't work, talk to a friend (not about him)!
do you have a pic page or something.
honestly, i like guys that haven't been with a lot of other girls.
you are the scum of the earth!!!
just means that they aren't playing games with their sexuality.
different times for different ladies, chump
oh, um, well it depends on your relationship.
if you love others, they will love you back
he already cheated your cousin and i think he will cheat in you some other time.
trust me i am a relationship dr.
boohoo for me because i still think of him.
or just pretend he isnt there.
nope, but who is really happy anyway?
it's easy to say yes, but i have a feeling it would be tough to do.
u don't need to worry about that.
there is no way that that's the problem.
doesn't mean he's puttin' the moves on elsewhere but i would be suspicious !
well do not show off that is a turn off and will give the impression ur cocky.
realize mom and dad are happy being apart.
so how do i get it to come out again?
your a guy love is a very wierd thing.
or whatever, he's a dumb guy anyway!
if it doesnt mean anything then y is she goin out w/ another gurl ?
please ,don't do this,you deserve nmore.you can but don't.
asian women are like the women of old.
just let her know that it bothers you if she does not stop run!!!
i will say wait till she's ready to wear a bra.
i prefer a friend to whom i can talk!
make him think u have intrest in his best-friend
send your ex a nice valentines day gift.
it ain't over till the fat lady sings!
click on my avatar and check out my questions ...they r like identicle!!
don't say that because most guys arent stupid.
you're making me feel like i just had two benadryl...
and does it matter if your shy?
and if i got my ass dumped for it, i'd deserve it.
doesnt mean he doesnt care about you.
most bad kissers are bad kissers cuz they dont even know they are.
heck no move one, been there done that sheet.
if u dont doubt him anymore.. ur instincts r always d best sign
dark hair, dark eyes, olive skin
if he is hot and you really like him, i would but that's my opinion know you decide
i only care who she is now.
to risky if you ask me(which you just did).
when the ache from the love consumes perhpas...
just hit me up and we'll talk about this one.
guaranteed there is someone who likes her that she's missing because she's obsessed with this other guy.
i am not sure but if you find mine, let me know cause i want it back.
they dont want to be your friend anymore?
no dear its not a good idea untill and unless u get a perfect partner
did you ask him what lead him to cheat?
that is just too much skin for me!!!!!!!
wait, even now all thier stuff is bullshit.
then u distract her and bail out!
invite him for a dinner or movie!
love them because god loved you first.........
so you can lean from it
the same reason most women are stupid!
learn how to spell cant understand your question
find someone better, someone you deserve.
im not sure but you have to be careful.
it's not all about how long, it's about how long and how thick!
try a card if you cant just say i love you
or that he would like to see you wear, and then go back and buy it.
dont force it because you might make a mistake.
why should she miss anyone who in the first place wasnt hers?
no, because my breast to big
i see it online everywhere.. i was just wondering
not very sexy if you ask me.
talk this one out girl before you make a bigger mistake...
just come in front of her and tell her that you are the man of her dreams!
well how old are u and i would like to be ur friend
yes get out of there quick
they just think differantly than you.
just move on with your life and find someone else.
i think you got a boyfriend.
the one i had with your mom.
do any other girls feel the same..?
don't you really mean, how many minutes into the first date????
i like him but i don't know if he likes me.
sometimes it dosnt matter if you no how to use it.
what kind of friend are you looking for?
how much does your balls sweat?
but lately he avoids me & wont even talk to me.
dance for him with something sexy!
i like girls with nice personalities
i like school teachers...but i'm not one.
but sometimes he acts like he still does.
depends how far you would let me go...
he obviously is trying to hit another girl so i would back off.
and have a happy valentines day!
always happy...waking up this morning...at work now.
have i told... you lately that your cuuuuuuuuuuuutee!
keep your head high and dont give up hope if things dont work out!
there are some good country boys out there that would love to have a good country girl!!)
ask her out on a casual date.
and do not encourage your girlfriend to become a stirpper.
because that description surely screams flirting!!!!!!
yeah my boyriend is crazy abou my toes!
if you love someone then you sacrifice being with other people.
good luck and have a nice day!
when i had sex with a guy who worked like a machine.
do he still like me r is he playing games
if you love someone it's because who the are not because the color of their skin
there isnt supposed to be any false love...so i guess true love is just a euphemism
if you only want your ex then leave the rest alone.
theres no need to keep playin games.
ur probably so d*mn ugly he has no choice but to look.
just tlak to her ask her out to dinner or something like that.
if she likes you - great.
come on yaar its ok now.
just be like hey lets kick it some time!
first of all dont call then stupid and ugly because they like u.
maybe he thinks its your fault that u have a baby.
you can't really tell that soon, i don't think.
if she is getting jealous then their must be a reason why.
he needs to see what it's like firsthand.
find me for alot of fun!
no but he see u more bitful at night cuz ur father is sleeping lol
i bet you are a beautiful person and should not be gealous of it...go out there and have fun!
don't let these girls lie to you!
a question that left you busting up laughing
you are truely a sad case!!!!!!
and you can even tell him why if he ask.
what if the people were guys?
girl, it's not going to last, go out and have fun!
no, don't ask him, instead push his buttons so that he asks you out.
maybe because you are differant than every one else!
best way is look straight into his eyes and u will get the answer
besides... do we really want our moms to be liars?
tell him in his love language (we all have ours) find out his love language and speak it.
do you really want to spend the rest of you life with someone like that.
everytime i talk about it he says i am pushing him.
i would think that he is having sex with someone eles.
sometimes i come back to my hometown to get away which is across country to where he is.
remember that this guy needs to help pay for your expenses, too.
lol you juos laugh out loud and you should feel better
he is a guy what do you expect
could be, it sounds like he like he likes being around you... you never know!
y does the skin color matter??
get over yourself and go to that wedding!
my e-mail is _num_@yahoo.com i like new friends
if a black man breaks into my house is it fair to say most black people are criminals!
don't be a wimpy, winey, wuss.
i like the woman to be loud though!
if he has money and isnt a kreep stay!
cheat on you then write a note.
if you ask him i dont think he would lie to you.
have a good life, don't let him way you down.
the guy you are talking to is a psychopath, a control freak.
so that next day i went with my boyfriend out to eat to the place we were going to.
but there is no guys in this town (worth dating)!
i want her, to want me....
you shouldnt think that because then everyone will think u are stupid( like me.)
did his boss give him a hard time...?
and she just has this constant fear.
beautiful girls can be found everywhere, just look around you!!
because distance makes lies harder to hide.
here i expect he will go to jail even though you say it was mutual.
by the way, all those commercials saying, condoms don't always protect, well, something is better than nothing!!
if its a different one each week i doubt it... but check the signs: eye contack and flirting
should i break up with her or go with it and trust that she really loves me ?
dont ever go to places that u used to hang out.
should i go back or stay home?
but dont feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down,life is long.
yea u love him but u wanna risk him gettin sumthin an bringin it back ta u?
most guys aren't really stupid, you're just meeting the wrong people.
i think its a big myth that guys are just big, retarded sex fiends.
even though it's okay, your partner need not know everything you think about.
unless it was a good dream, of course.
if he want to just be friends , it's best to move on.
what comes aorund goes around sweetheart.
depends on the man of course!
it's very easy just buy him a flower and say that you love him
say adios to her, life is waaaayyyyy too short!
u know we do it too!
the boy is _num_-_num_ years old and he likes me.
but if you decide to go for it....have fun!
theres not much you can do if a guy does not want a relationship w you.
do things that makes you happy.
it depends on the girl i guess, but i lie all the time and people really buy it :)
the best town is ur imagination because if thats all you want you will never get anything
its not good to date them all
ever heard of a pajama party????
guys do like it when girls can spell (or at least aren't too lazy to look words up).
riza if you dont know why, then why answer for all you know its some creep
i've been there it the place is really great...
as for the guy just try to ignore him and eventually it will be forgotten!
but to answer your question no there is no way to understand men.
just wanting to meet friends in amsterdam
she act like she doesnt like so what should i do date here or leave her alone
you try to take it slow, no guy like to hear that he is a bad kisser.
that is like asking if love ever existed... not everyone is bad.
!are you some kind of schizoprinia?
what do you like bieng asked?
do crazy stuff like cover yourselves in whipped cream or something tasty.
dont jsut wait for something good to happen.
like he is really cute then what do you do then
threaten him by saing ur going to call the police if he doesnt pay child support!
even if they laugh at the time.
i'm not sure what to do
first and formost, for him just to say so shows the kind of man he really is.
if its because you like someone else- say that.
they are unwise and mean and they are gonna have to learn the hard way.
makes _num_ quick access i guess?
he got waaaay too many girl friends help me im confused!!
i say right on to being a virgin it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
you can stop trying to control her life?
why would a guy want to go out with an frigid ice princess such as yourself.
i'm just trying to avoid any quarrels... she gets jealous pretty easily!
some men are scared of marige, and stuff so a good talk might help!
so men, why would you or wouldnt you date a virgin?
because when they think their head hurts because they have no brain!and boys are just boys!
why so many men dream about living with an asian girl.
but i guess it really depends on if you want an emotinal attatchment.
close your eyes and do your thing
once a cheat, always a cheat...
talk to me-- you can't be that lonely !!
anger makes you say you can't hurt me anymore!
because, in all honesty, that is so sexy just in itself.
get with somone more in tune with your maturity level
i would not be attracted to her in the first place
its healthy and natural,but if you dont becareful you can get some nasty viruses!
and take a good look in the mirror.
he got what he wanted... he is done with you.
most guys, as you probably know, are horny all of the time.
i would also question how much of a friend is your best friend??????
if you're considering taking him back don't.
send him a message from ur mobile!
god moves in many ways ?
when u r at least _num_
he loves you for being his only!
omg i had the same problem look at the awnsers i got.
and your time and your life!
he'll understand and think nothing of it.
hope that helps (if even a little).
please try to remember this: the leading cause of divorce is getting married!!
if he is unwilling to lick it then don't let him stick it.
i wish then you would have no problem getin laid(@)(@)
yeah... i did that and it sucked!
you just cannot force yourself on anyone or you will not have anyone.
if you are not growing and having fun, then the relationship is dead.
i also have that problem but if your nice in bed, i'm pretty sure she won't even notice.
get her things that actually mean something.
depends on how old are you
having younger friends will help make up think & feel younger =)
say back off bitch i hate u
i don't think the hubby desearved to have it!
you get in life what you pay for.
yeah its possible...it happens a lot to me
no, i'm a girl, i only think about sex if i'm realy in love of some guy
if he's cheating then kick him to the curb.
and think of this if you think of nothing else...s-t-d's he may bring one home to you!
no there is no way that girls will ever understand guys.
party it up while your young.
i heard your geting married, when it is ?
try some honesty, it works for me
him asking you out is up to him, you blew it.
but i absolutely love italian women!
still trying to figure that one out myself
if she's really, really ugly, then yes - not having sex is very beneficial.
why their more exciting sports are the ones with a lot of contact?
once you have moved on then you wont care if he moves on or not.
first of all, that's not typical of a guy.
but most woman talk about it for sure, there are noveltie parties with sex toys.
except that didn't end too great... :(
think about it before that way you wont get tunge tied
do it when you are married
she does it again, shame on you.
okay so about _num_ months ago this all started with flirting.
go out with ur ld friends to meet other new friends.
he will accidently run into u out & about.
if she is aromantic, get her some flowers and chocolate eventhough valentines day is over.
i don't know about you but i don't like the bad boy type.
(sung as off key as possible) silly songs are the way to go!
maybe even try to hook him up with a friend!
i found someone at a strip club whom i married.
but i may whant it more then guys.
they actually have younger brains than we do.
him nd i met through a friend(his bro.)
you should think it through very good.
yes there are, i am not one of them.
hello how are you?what you neam?i just want friend in amsterdam please send to me sincarely shaba
i'm not a prude at all, i love oral sex, porn, i'm good looking.
just like most of the time guys dont understand girls.
your bestfriend is not a friend if he had sex with your girl.
i dunno.. maybe i'm just not born _num_ lie _num_ much.
the least she could say is no.
i think about sex non-stop, and even more than all of my guy friends.
it feels bad and sad ok bye
is sad how some people are..
listen to the song baby baby stay gone by jimmy wayne.
i dont even talk to other guys.
if that doesnt work i dont know what to tell you because it works for me sometimes
if she already has a guy then you just have to set your sights elsewhere.
you back up everything you say to her it's pretty simple
if it doesnt fit in the mouth
ask him if he likes your kids if he dont thin brack up beceas family comes _num_
u can tell by the way they look at u and the way the person talks _num_ u
i have been to a few.
not all gals, but some do.
i would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you!
ur future is not bright it;ll leads u to death.
what are indications of a man flirting?
why should u kill that innocent baby
your guess is as good as mine.
well mine is _num_ to _num_ inchs
remember bill gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
strike _num_, he no like kids.
best friends always come before girls.
a girl who loves him and cares about him.
don't run he is just talking.
keep that, you may find he is a really cool guy and want to stay friends
if this guy says no he won't help.
ignore it when people start rumors.
if you find out how let me know.good luck
no, i am not soft, just trying to be fair.
dude, i hate to say it but she was cheating on you with this guy before you broke up.
i invited her over and we went inside my room and i shut the door lol.
theres this hella hot guy in my neighberhood.
i am a gemini actually but honestly spiking i dnt bliv in horoscopes.
it's the only thing real serious ladies are serious about.
instead of a girl u should get a guy for your own likings
but i enjoy necking and even a little caressing.
and i don't really think too much about it.
don't say to much stuff.say hi!!
hold your head up and smile.
all i can say is don't look back.
is it ok for me to have sex with my gf?
if you have a baby then the baby has a daddy.
i went to clubs and that was just for a fun night.
so thats ur answer yes they say that wont cheat....
would have sex with more than one guy at once?
personally i dont think that that is useful.
what if you're interested in a lady, but not sure if she is in you?
when your boyfriend dose not im u or call u for _num_ weeks what would u do
but if you have to ask you are probably too young or immature to really get married.
yes because almost all men are like that
its all up to you.just dont look too hard.
it does not mean good things for you as far as dating her goes.
my guy friends all say confidnece (not arrogance though) is sexy.
well, emmm... maybe you can call her or work really hard to earn some money and buy a car??
sleep with his brother, or best friend.
or you could spred rumors about her where ever you are.
don't send an im that says asl?
im telling you this from personal experience.
but woman do talk about it alot!
she did it once, shame on her.
it can even help your relationship
so spill the beans and let it fall where it lands.
i saw them last year they were great etc
do you really want someone that doesn't know what he wants?
let her try on a sports bra.
tell her that you love her and try to find money,,,,,,
(you all know you were thinking it!!)
i don't know you to love you!
stop having sex with him which you should not be doing in the first place....
you get bored easily when with him/her.
you know your man, if you trust him don't worry.
you know what you should do.
ask him about it, if he denies it, and u no he is cheating, dump him
if he/she really made u happy u would be glad to sayback off not flirt.
oh, and as good as it may sound, dont do anything for valentines day!
the gay guys love listening to them.
if he did call it was atleast once a week.
most guys arent stupid, u just associate with the stupid ones
i would say that is not okay because just because hes a guy doesnt mean that its right!!
my wife said it just depends on her mood at the time
well if u are really lookin for advice... don't do it...
first of all don't do anything that you don't want to.
is it coz he doesnt trust me?
you are young ....you need to talk to your mom about that...
sorry its always gona be aucword and kinda weiro ish.
i just want some good love songs to listen to i know it's kind of sappy but whatever
divorce is not something that kids like.
tell her there's something you've been wanting to tell her.
i can't believe he is telling you.
i believe being with someone is the best!
and this is the first time i ever had to do anything like this for anyone..please help me!
keep it that way no matter how mad she gets.
that's a stupid question to ask, if you don't know you never will.
i dont live there so couldnt tell ya sorry
ask her why she in the relationship and how she feel about you
i like it from the back!!!!!!!!
they like it up on top or bent over bow-wow style!
follow ur heart...wat feels rite _num_ u?
don't let some other girl get a chance with your crush.
love without sex and sex after marriage is best
if i can't stop thinking about the guy i like, i just focus hard on my work or read.
good question i'm a girl so us girls will never know!
that has _num_ be the worst thing to do to your friend roght now!
you dont like him, you like his friend,why not tell him?
hope you get some new friens soon...
unfortunately if you have to ask, probably.
are u wanting to get married?
sex is like air & water.
don't give him too many chances.
well... if you like her guess it is ok.
i know he loves me even more because i was still a virgin on our wedding night!
but i would not agree that girls should attack first!
depends on if you are a girl too or not.
as a guy, i know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..
try this, did this person have sex with their spouse before they got married?
is that a question for a guy?
try looking someplace besides the losers section.
give him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
well it depends.. how old r u & how old is ur mom???
if you are even asking this question, i think you are probably too young to be getting married.
wait and see what she has to say.
ease into it, don't just jump on him.
it is called, he's just not that into you.
i can tell ya one thing if you cheated on her goddess help you soul!
you have to be confident flirt with us a lil but be sweet too.
don't have sex w/ him and see what he does...haha great advice i know!
but i really really like him
if u agree with him no prob but wot do u feel?
most of all - have fun!
however, that doesn't mean it's over.
i know he wouldn't want me to either!
they don't have to be christian to cheat the women do it too.
iam sure they think the same thing about girls.
to show sumone actions or phrases in like of that person
if he did, he wouldn't cheat.
but we never got together, because i was with his best friend *matt.
as long as he really doesnt know the chicks it wont matter...
and you should be very respectable about it to.
ok he is _num_-_num_ and you are how old??
i can't believe i wasted years of my life being with trash like you!!
i'm just looking to spice things up in my room...what should i try?
but that takes time to develope.
honey just come right out and tell him about the phone call.
you said it yourself hes in love with another lady!
i would hit it even if she was still dripping from his sex
my friends can't stand him and constantly picks on him.
and let your personality shine through and dont be fake, girls can sense that.
thats funny u asked that cuz i kinda felt like that about a girl once, cant really explain why.
get used to guys that just want to use you.
it's fate that does that :)
my moms friend willy lives there...find ppl on myspace...theres tons of ppl from everywhere
grab a male who you never met and have sex or get married right at that moment.
a picnic lunch in a beatiful, quiet, private setting.
wanna be careful you don't end up in that hostel..
if its something you enjoy then whats wrong with that?
when you want to give him a bear hug everytime you see him
everything reminds me of him and wat used to be.
its so natural, why make issue out it?
i just broke up with my gf but its harder to get another one can u help me
did he do it on purpose???
i was thinking about how to kiss her next time:)
but this girl i really do love.
as long as she isn't thier boss.
a not circumcised penis is pretty nasty!!!!
from my on experince it depend's on the both of you.
....if she doesn't like you enough to remain only with you, it's not worth it.
i'm _num_ years old and _num_
have a fun and interessing honeymoon!
my bf notices so many girls when hes driving and he tries not to make it obvious.
i hate those kind so remember money can buy lots of things apart from class, style and grace
dont take action, cuz she'llget hers eventually.
oh, and if guys knew u said that nobody would like u, just so u know.
life is like that, everyone hurting each other.
i lost my virginity at the age of _num_, i honestly didn't know what the hype was all about.
just ask him if he would mind if you sent such pics.
no but you should take care of it before you try to get preganant
if he says its nothing, tell him you're not stupid.
did you not say for better or worse.
anytime he says come here , there you go right behind him.
to my bestsest friend (x infinity _num_) your friend forever i like cereal ^-^
a baby can't decide if it wants to live or die.
it makes me feel good about myself when other guys hit on me and flirt with me.
one said, i can't leave my kids, the other said, why do you want to have coffee with me!
where is he working.. how many hours... ask him.
_num_ i think no need to rush though.
some guys really dont like any playing with their bums.
women are a mystery, and we like it that way!!!!!!!!
however i really do love her.
i don't think he doesn't trust you.
i like this one guy who used _num_ be in my class.
i just like to get some advice.
isn't it torture for one and ego for the other ...
tell them you love them, and see if they tell you back
that's who we r it's in r blood and there is nothing u can do
im soooooooooooo loud we got complaints from our neighbors... no joke
well one day i sat him down and told him i liked him.
be blunt... hey, you guys going to let me in on the conversation or what?
he will defnetly get it at one point
if this boy like you you should go with him.
pick me but be a little more specific on type or stereo i mean age counts too!
no one can control their dream.
haven't you seen the paris hilton video yet?!!?!
trust me, guys don't know what's best for a girl.
go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it...
she says that it doesnt mean anything and that is every guy's dream.
or hang out with best buddies, take your mind off of him, have fun, girl.
i cant answer that coz i havent experienced it.. but i think its possible
i think she just wants to come to america like everyone else...but thats just me...peaceout !
he probably thinks it's a good thing.
the admiration s not enough reason to kiss
and crying is ok....but talking is more productive.
knocked up girls lose intrest that way.
talk to the guy and figure out wut made him act like such a jerk
would i date a stripper, probably not.
you no longer want to see his/her face.
he didn't care if he knew!!!
some guy was following me in a store and said i never liked levi's jeans until now, i ran.
they used to be best friends, but now they arent.
i want to be myself but not scare her away, what should i do?
it sounds like you're more hung up on virginity than most guys would be.
just tell him without having sex with him and you won't come over being cheap!
she never got over you the first time...
y do u marry him when he's quiet and noe u want him to talk to u?
be young - have fun... don't take life so seriously.
sorry but no, get a job
no if your over _num_ you might as well be _num_
i dont like to hurt anyone.
no, he just likes to talk to you
your _num_ year already has a daddy
all i really want is my ex to realize that i only want him.
find some barry white stuff, it works.
you could find the most beatiful natural blonde and tall girl in this world but she wouldn't be smart!!
looking back, i am not really sure why i did it!
maybe cause u sound so sorry
be honest... ask him what he thinks... its a good way to start dont you think?
i kind of ruined jons friendship with matt.
it probably wasn't the brightest thing for him to tell you, but i wouldn't worry about it.
i like this one guy *jon & he used to like me too.
and to top it all off, i didn't get to come, cuz that headboard thing lost the whole mood.
i'd give you _num_ for that one!!!!
they have lots of great suggestions on there.
start talking about kids around your parents
um...i didn't...i let the man come to me and ask me out!
i found out my gf was really a boy.
she knows she has to move on but she can't....any ideas that might help her out?
you just answered your own question.
cause they think theryre popular and hott and they just are when it comes to dating
for the majority it is quiet unless it is super goooooooooooood then i will be loud
some are 'snugglers', some are not.
don't be dumb like i have been.
but i'm not the one who did anything wrong.i love him so much what should i do?
and i say this because its true.....its not the only thing.
jon & i used to be really close & talk all the time about anything & everything.
or he tells you he doesn't wanto do it rigth now?
then i started smoking and drnking.
why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that way?
if gurls dont like u for that they have problems
can't he get a girl to share hers with him?
my advise: dont go out with a stranger.
be honest ....with him, and yourself,do you really want him back?
go to iraq and keep in touch.
at times i think only sex.
when a girl likes u, u should be able to kno help me girls!!!
they just want to be loved
a compromise position is to refuse to hang out with her when she's been drinking.
but he tells me that they dont mean anything to him.
move on girl@ go have fun!
i think you just lust for him.
also tell him you had a bad experience with another guy that tried some stuff and made you mad.
no, seriously.. don't get him another dog!
for me a girl beein mature!
was i not attractive to him that night?
he doesn't love you, break up with him and don't even listen to his excuses!
i'd work with him some more.
believe me, sweetheart, people are not always who they first appear to be.
you cant stop it..its like a reflex and we are just prone to do it.
i for one dislike fake boobs.
that's how life works... there will always be ups and downs in your life... just accept it.
you have to take a stand.
but your bf isn't you bf.
i started likin _num_ i didnt before when they asked me out so just ask.
can i get custody even though he has been a stay at home dad?
men want ladies out in public, and sluts at home in the bedroom.
give him a bl*w job once in a while.
maybe a hot bath for both of you!
go intoroduce yourself, smile, be nice to her...
are u matuer enough to handle a serious relationship?
when women get togeather thats one of the main toppics.
odds are you wouldn't get married anyway so find someone new!
because we make them nervous and their brains jus go out the window!
becuase they usually just like to make you feel bad.
and they are more romantic.. that what i think..
you are too young and too many things can go wrong.
theres a reason why dis happened so jus be patient...evry cloud has a silver lining *hugs*
remember, just because a guy knows your involved, doesnt mean he wont try anyway.
i wouldnt even loose _num_ seconds on a girls thts a major hotty and still stupid!
yes it is beneficial to not have sex.
a guy too tired for sex?
youare no old in fact you need to do things that you like doing ?
well if you wanna meet some hot mama citas i would go to the library or maybe walmart.
in the meanwhile continue to flirt, care or adore him and better still know him!!
don't let him see you down.
yes...if its a male friend he already likes u, just so u know...
honey, trust me i am a guy.
tell him you don't want to marrie him and if he keeps it up run
do you prefer circumcised or foreskin and why
so the next day i e-mail one of them and she said she didnt want to be my friend.
how do i get out of it?
no, that makes u the girl of my dreams!!!
we get to know eachother better
believe that you will find your true love someday... just have faith...
once a cheater always a cheater!
we fall for girls of all shapes and sizes.....every guy is defferent
of course.. just tell him everything you know
pretend to be a girl looking for a nsa relationship and im him..:p
and he thought i enjoyed myself.
she tells me that she really loves me.
count me in for that :)
only if u guyz r best friends
he didn't love you, know how i know?
your charming smile baby, which costs nothing
dont care about them just leave them cz trust me u wont get anywhere with these people
sex with love of course... you have to love that person you are making love with... it`s really important...
when i catch him staring at a woman he denies it and yells at me.
don't let a man walk all over you.
jesus - why not poke every man's eyes out?
it means that u've got a new little sister!
i am _num_ and i waited until i was married to have sex.
yes its ok, everyone is attracted to other people.
do guys even think that is cute/sexy?
_num_ a guy cheats you are hanging out with the wrong men.
so you like a lesbian and your not a lesbian that makes no sense what so ever
but now he ignores me again.
buy her a rose bouquet for v-day and ask her out.
im me now on yahoo messenger using my id :pao__num_
get lost i need two points sry i am being a b**** not
i've got this friend and she's going gaga over this guy who doesn't like her back.
you dont want to lose him as a friend.
get some cool electronics out of the deal.
start showin him more lovin attention!
may god and your fellow soldiers preserve you
but you aren't really asking anything here.....
most will if they get the chance but your not married so .............its about _num_ i think
i agree with rockhead don't tell anyone
you should have sex when you're horny.
you get even by becoming a better person then you were before you met her.
_num_ my _num_ time (& last) time having sex while watching telivision.
u cant get married in jail
why don't you just email him your question?
because most of them are horny assholes that can't get any.
look around you everyone is beautiful
see how it goes from there
u are surfing the net..yahoo answers obviously!
i dunno..i just know that i just gained _num_
dump him, just because you love him ...doesn't mean he love you.
because pain is pleaser, & when one bleeds it's like an orgasm!
no, but that is because guys have different horomones than girls do.
ha ha that stuff is all true thats how i get sometimes...
i wouldn't take it that seriously, it's only a dream.
that means you can have your cake and eat it too!!!!
it's time to move on...maybe it hurts but that's life.
dont hurt him but dont hurt yourself either...
it's just the way of life
we're not talking about flirting as in playing dumb.
when my girlfriend bit my cock off and ate it
you tend to love the person more when you have sex
so theres a lot more out there then what is happening right now.
u can hold a _num_ coversation witha boy just talking about himself.
_num_ marriage is not a joke!
if you like him go out with him why the hek do you have to ask here?
i never thought i would get asked out but i did.
if i like a guy i ask him out before another girl out him out.
hahahaha yeaah right like i am going to post that kind of personal info
sounds like a break up to me........
my boyfriend of alittle over a year now has continued to lie to me throughout our relationship.
its the same reason mine is.
yup..as long as he love you den its not a problem anymore..loves doent mean money..dun judge it by money
she will always be there _num_ you ,care about you
i fell to my knees, i won't ever forget that weird moment.
but she doesnt trust me cause ive said similar things to both of them.
i garantee that all the girls that think they think about sex a lot have no effin idea.
just be original.that's all you gotta do.
if your in a relationship with one, you better think it over if she is worth all the pain.
why don't you get a job, and then you'll have money of your own.
because they are to in love and they think that theres hope
oooh....thats a tough one....just go out with her friend then shell want you
is sex soooooo good that people are willing to risk so much??
best revenge: move on with your life and forget that the cheater ever existed.
it's like your happy most of the time and you're always glowing.
(careful if hes a non-understanding homosapien)
becaue my train of thought ran off the track and bumped all other men's off to
you cant and i would be disrespectful to the minister
if it hurts, and the woman can't take it, it's way to long.
i think it's time to for you to move on...
got a good cast iron skillet?
any man who doesnt like kids is a coward to responsibility !!
dat was bad....... never again tv will be on during sex.
tell her if she loved you she would come over and fuck your brains out and swallow your kids
if you can't take it to be his friend then leave him alone
you feel the best feeling uve ever felt in your whole life
but only when theyare in the mood or if you spice the moment.
and what does it stands for?
if you can (and its about love), its probably good.
not all guys it depends on the guy.
yes it is but are you in love?
because red is blody color but we sey blue is love
they end up thinking you`re a total bastard.
as long as that person says it's ok.
especially if your used to having sex on a regular basis.
or maybe someone is trying to break you guys apart.
having sex with a guy who was toooooo smallllll!!!
what's so shameful sex is freakin' awesome!
i cant stop thinking about him.
old man says:hey baby,wanna see me change my teeth.
that's more exciting u know.shyness sucks.
don't spend a lot of money.
i wouldnt dump my girl over those i have gotten nude pics from.
just look at her eyes and smile.
couldn't have been bad if they married anyway.
friend, spouse, or even your family members.
u better leave his a$$ u can do bad all by yoself!!
but, to make this person stay with u is a dificult part.
if ur in bangalore i am here :)
he lies to me and hangs up in my face.
i don't think it's a sin, but it surely ends in fornication!!!
lol... well, i think that being on that beach next to the fire with _num_ sounds pretty darn good!!
you are going to find someone else and wonder why you forgave this guy so many times!
depends if you believe in books about what dreams mean i guess...
takes a lot of patience, i bet.
what in the hell should i say??
but, we are happy and enjoy life!
you marry becasue you want to spend the rest of your life with the man!
he always says sorry..but then a month later hes lying and being dishonest.
i start quiet and get louder and louder and then....baaaammmm!!
i can't help thinking, was it me?
not all guys care only about sex.
prob his way of good time is sex.
if you like a man talk to him and get to know him
it really depends how ugly she is.
so just make sure she knows how much you love her.
do not tell him face to face, it may have been good at one time it wont be now.
well then recognize what you dont want to
o and trust me it can get bad!!!
guys r not scared of the word love.
nope.. maybe he wants _num_ hear ur voice _num_ he tucks himself _num_ bed.
would u make out with him, even if u werent officially going out.
your wrong on that one personal issues huh?
when you cant get that person off your mind
i would ask her if it was urs
how could anyone not like kids ???
twice first one i met and wanted to marry right then, the second is still unravelling.
i told him how do you know i'm looking at you ????
and their friends will bad talk you to theirs and so on and so on
asking this cuz is like it is always guys that is ready and up for sex..
never let anyone tell you different
jealousy is a heck of a demon to fight.
- dress up & act ladylike.
as soon as they get mad beacause you wont have sex with them, dump them.
if that doesn't do it, then i'm stumped.
i don't like the way they cus.
yes ya not and now that person seem to be a good frined
first of all this is not the right age match the desires differ...so be careful
the rest is just window dressing.
jus tell her how you feel and why you love her
well he wont be married much longer.
i mean beauty is skin deep!
u r not considered unless u do it back in return.
she was kind of this outcast punk rocker chich with big blue eyes.
sending money is not better, your kid wants you there!!
have you ever heard of descriminating based on sexual orientation...and how that is wrong???
i actually prefer hispanic men above all!
if i do then why would i be snooping around in his stuff?
not love, but who knows right?
but definately force her because no bra is very unattractive.
probably the flirting led you to beleive he did want more?
if that doesn't work tell him that you have an std.
she is nothing special to others, but she is my true love... that's all !!
in places where there are black men...duh!
hell no, u must be smart
if youre talkin about here, the internet, that is a wrong place.
ive actually heard alot of guys say that thye prefer virgins.
oh not to mention a cute a$$ and small boobies ( ya as weird as it is!
because they are an orgasm addict
if the guy doesn't like her, then advice to move on.
obviously you decided you don't want to sleep with him or you would have already.
if so how many years have you been married?
try yes if u like him and no if u dont!
trust ur humor, beauty, intelligence, relation with other, how u conenct... and the like.
you are doing the right thing just devorce him, and get back to your life.
stop thinking about what could be and dreaming.
if he realy loves you than he wouldnt care if you have nothing to offer.
some places to go to: beaches, restaurants,...etc.
yes tell him the worst he will do is say no
hay just be friends with him
after i busted him cheating of course.
well try kissing him...are there any sparks?
yeah but you get more horny than fall in love
games, games games, don't play them, you always loose.
to each their own but i'll still be eating my chocolates and enjoying my roses while you...........?
just remember a man is stll a man.
so......you wanta have sex or not?!!
_num_ of all you can't help what you dream about, and _num_ fantasizing is just that, a fantasy.
if my sister's friend shit on me i would leave the room immediately!
but i will expect her to do the same..so just get with better guys....
if he gets the point, then stick it out...
and when she does, all she dreams about is him.
dont compromise your salvation for anyone.
yes, i guess i like the thugish type of guys.
i was _num_ that was _num_ months ago an im still with her.
do you think she'll know that you like her without telling her?
just don't tell her you love her too early.
they can never be what you are.
i care about him a lot, and i miss him.
u broke up leave it _num_ him
i noticed you like goo goo dolls have you ever seen then in concert.
maybe she's not a material kind of girl.
there really is no way to answer that without sounding like a racist of which i am not.
its basically deciding who i want to marry.
just remember its up to you if u dont want to u dont have to!
later on that month things started changing.
really tell her to think twice.
how about a nice homemade personalised gift!
then it is up to her to listen or not and find out in the hard way or not
there not the kind of guy you want.
have you ever had a fallout like that?
you dont even know how old he is???
as little as possible forgive and forget
older as in _num_ - _num_ yrs so he's alot matured
at least you can trust us cause even if we lie you'd know!
movies are fun, but it doesnt provide much bonding.
she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work.
i can tell u that all girl think different.
dreams are just that dreams and it is our brain working things out.
but be extra careful, you're playing with fire!
knock that bastard upside his head.
you might not like it but pretend to.
marriage is better, no one said that it was going to be easy.
if not someone will find u
how old r u well that doesn't even matter run
i'm just not attracted you anymore.
if i did, yahoo answers would not be where i would look!
if you try it once...its menas you tried it once.
if my hubby cheated, i'd probably chop his thing off and hang it from the mustang's rearview mirror...
i get hungry twice a day.
i laughed my ass off when i read it.
i luv talking to him, it's like i don't feel real good unless i talk to him.
friends are hard to come by..
mr nobody get drunk and kiss her that is how i did it three year ago.
if the boy has such an attitude of mind he's not worth ur love even if u r simple.
so thats why i went with matt.
my yahoo chat name used to be 'iscreamifyoudoitright'
just ask her she'll probably like you to have some help
she or he will get it.
my wife gave me a kiss and took off with the kids.
undress yourself infront of him u will know
then, i learned that he likes me.
i am cause if i wasnt then i'd be w. a girl lol!!
if he has friends though then maybe he likes you.
why in the world wouldn't a guy date a virgin?
who here has married their high school sweetheart?
did u watch movie the game?
leave him alone he got what he wanted and maybe don't want to talk to you anymore
leave him alone or you might be running into trouble.
i have gotten dates, not as many as if i played stupid.
i bet you'll fall for me once you see me.
but you're probably too good for her anyway.
and if not the pet store... just look around the barns.
u dont just lose the bi**h cuz she will stay to hurt u and love doing it.
it's very easy....just tell him... talk to me or get out of my life thats all honeybun
just say i love me too.
its not so good for the person who has the available booty.
well obviously if she won't tell you she doesn't want you to know.
i asked him if he still liked me & he said no.
and look at pictures of guys.
do whats right and listen to your heart!!
why don't you have a job?
just be a cool guy, don`t take girls for granted.
you're a fucking retard and if you were my kid you wouldn't be allowed to date.
she is using you to get over here!!!
u need to talk to him about it and tell him to stop
i need to know if its alright
have sex right before you go to bed
if he speaks about it then listen to him and show that u care.
don't even do that to yourself!!!
same reason why men do it!~ ^_^
dude you forget about that you move on you find someone who loves you
a boyfriend thats his friend to.
(read my q&a)...i was dating my new girls friend, n i dumped her.
if he is cute to u and got a nice personality then say yeah duhhhhh!
if he likes you, tell him you love him... it gets things moving, worked like a charm for me!
if you are a boy then sure!
i am scared to ask him if he stills likes me, because i liked him too.
ask her permission if in doubt!!
in no way do you need him or anyone bring you down.
i couldn't hurt someone i cared about that way.
have u cheated on her in the past?
i cant stand a woman like that.
no but u can be so one's bi***
secret admirier notes,with clues leading up to you
repeat donot tell him face to face.
no never u have to get to know her
love will find a way, if you guys really are meant to be...
this is the problem in america!
either you get along with this person or you do not.
dunno, cook him dinner, show him u care.
we think we are giving them signals but they dont get it.
although i'm sure if they could we all know what the decission would be.
maybe you should not be worried at all.
kiss her on the cheek first and if she knows what u mean shell carry on from there.. ;)
my husband and i moved in after _num_ weeks go _num_ it
ain't the size kiddo, it's how u use it.
i think everybody has a right to enjoy my girlfriend doin stripping.. u r welcome to the party too.
_num_ you hear that love song and all you think about is them.
but do you love somebody ?
but even if, she's still ur friend.
i know alot just email me and i will tell you
dont try to impress her at all.just let her know that you like her
do u have irish in you?
maybe that is why it is called fantazys
some learn it and do well, others do not.
but they dont have to be half naked.
so if you find the answer let me know.
i wanna do things to you i wouldn't even do to an oreo.
i am really mature so don't mess with me!
don't just go to him and say hey i wanna bone your sister really bad.
until then, quit being such a jerk.
if you really like him you will just know.
not a bad person at all!!
i doesnt matter if u do it right!
be nice and relaxed and let her know that you like her.
people don't do things they don't get something out of.
i believe a woman should make her own decission.
you should call him and ask him
i am a _num_ yo female.
people have lots of reasons why they have not found that right person.
you can still be friends...hell even friends with benefits.
and you really want him to ask you to marry him
look forget the fu?k and go out with me!!!
and just do it, if yo wait you will never get anywhere.
look you just have to be normal.
every once in a while, i won't, just for a change.
start looking for someone more compatable and closer your age
have i told... you lately... that i lub you...?
well it cna mean many differnt things.
i say, look what you wearing.
when youlike a guy who like you back
that you aint getting none homie
next, you should totally focus on getting to level _num_, real fast, okay ?!
she should decide to prevent getting pregnant.
no, coming from a girl, i dont think about sex as much as my ex boyfriend did.
i don't like a big cry baby though!
why would you want to marry someone that is in jail for one..????
we have flurted may times but i just don't know *_*
it is not men ,it is the boy you went out with.
but i took an instant dislike for him.
then of course there are many questions on wheather i've been f---ked up the a--.
just speak with your eyes baby!
women want it slow......and take too long for it......men want it without a tease.
and we sat on my bed and looked in her eyes and huged her and kissed/made out with her
why get married.... just become some ones biotch
u've gotta accept the sad truth.
don't you love your xgf at all?
so it's either get over him, or wait.
beside now this days its hard to find a virgin!
repeat after me....you are a lying dirt face!
-im just wondering- -thanks for answering-
go hang around with some really rough men, you know, a ' man's man'
i care for him a lot, but only as a friend.
i'm a self-proclaimed nympho, but i dunno if i'm just really nasty or really horny... all the time.
she might come clean to u if she doesn't want to be with u anymore.
honey, if you don't want to have sex with a guy, that's o.k.
first, who broke up with who?
dress like a decent lady and you will find nicer guys.
i'll try anything once and again if i like it
as long as there is no physical activity, i don't see why not
i don't know are u ready for one?
jon told me to stay with matt.
he will b pleasently suprised and will luv all the more for it:)
& i told him yes very.
cheat on her with one of her friends and treat her friend better than u treated her
if you're not planning to marry him, why bother?
the problem is that the girls that do smell.. think they don't.
most guys care about that, some don’t, it’s up to the guy.
tell him to go to hell!!!!
get yourself some self esteem and dump his ass.
its probably that woman don't like wussies!
but yeah, guys do think about sex more than girls.
mayb its cuz ur doin something wrong!!
older doesnt mean that his foot is in d grave.. lol.
are there reasons you do not trust him?
hand the mofo a toilet brush.
hit me up if u want more... digital_lyricist at yahoo dot com.
if you want to get married then do so.
astrology is a bunch of bunk.
men are beautiful no matter what.
ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
but to much of a good thing can turn in to a bother.
cuz they have a one track mind
he doesn't like your kids, you don't like his?
have your fun now when you are single.
because its called lust, which is a sin.
i guess i just have some anxiety about it.
but my new girl really means a lot to me.
make sure it's a good, clean fun.
now you get two of everything.
theres a mr right for every girl.
go to movies, sight seeings etc.
well now, that kind of difficult.
what you need to do is get mad!!!
maybe she wants to have sex but not with u.
where do u get these stats?
if you connect with someone, just don't worry about other people's feeling's... dr checko... (nickname)
i love having phone sex w/my bf.
just tell him to his face in a nice way, that its over.
its easy find someone to marry you in the jail
what if some guy would ask, why are all woman _num_?
she might do it agin oh and thanks i'll let him know.
don't let anybody ever tell you different.
oh, and if the guy is to marry the girl, she can't have slept with too many other guys.
i am an old fashioned kind of guy.
if you are with an unsaved (sinner) you are a sinner too.
no phisical contact, no eyes contact, no hand contact, just the faith that the other one says the truth...
maybe she also got the same feeling as u are..............
good looks,good habbits & ofcourse a great figure makes a girl a good girlfrind
why not get a job and send him money?
give her something really nice and then ask right there on the spot.
then she will think you are really hiding something.
stop thinking about looks and start looking at people on how they treat u
can _num_ here speak clear english?
it's about the one you're with.
who could say no to that?
repeat after me it's not my fault!
i got _num_: u judge for yrself.
she asked me about my feelings...
my old man don't he just go right to it and get in it
then one day he started flirting with me.
only if u feel like u need a boyfriend.
no because the same thing happened to me but it might be different
would it bother him if you did were asking guys for pictures?
u r jus experiencing new things which is a gud thing.
if not it wasn't meant to be.
and if he likes you for your activities, start doing things that he wouldn't like.
start talking about marriage ands kids and his family that might spook him
flowers, not roses that might be too strong.
you don't have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down!
when me & matt first got together i really liked jon, & i didnt know he liked me too.
hmm, i would hide their lunch box and not play with them at recess!
no, i think you cant spell.
you most likely can do alot better.
that would be none of your business !
and it makes ppl more anxious and jealous, so beware of that too.
i've had this problem so many times just stick with both of them but just play your cards rigtht!!!!
it may to late to attempt abort.
so i will tell you what alot of the guys i know dream of.
if he treated her right then i see nothing wrong with it its not like she is your sis
boys love themselves its sick man.
if she likes you then she should know that your new at it.
it depends on u. but would u want to?
but it jus bothers me cus i want _num_ w/ him but i wanna wait!!
if you like another guy though you should probably just say that!
is it that you don't have one, or your ehaving trouble with the one you have?
and hes not a druggie or nothing like that.
just be friendly not fwd i.e.
and he probuble did not awnser your calls cause he was truely bussy
ask them wen theyre hooked up _num_ a lie detectotr
i like him but..im not in love with him.
go to the gym - workout practice speaking with a lower your voice be confident
i would just be straight up with your friend.
you can do better, doll !
tell him your baby is in need of him
i feel old too and i'm _num_
don't blow it on a thing called sex.
y cant they just treat us with respect?
if he is still talking to her, he is probably cheating on you or very close to it.
but once she leaves him karma goes around so it will go back to him.
i would say in most cases yes
plus, women aren't just ready you need to help...
don't ask let him say it on his own
but if i had to choose...black... white men just don't do it for me..
no, if you already free him in you're life and find another girl.
well now im pregnant with his kid... how do i tell him without him going balistic!!!???!!!???!!!
dont drag it out, but make it short and to the point.
would u like to be called stupid?
i dunno cuz me and my fiance are like that to.
my guy does he says that it gives him an oppunity to tell be how beautiful i am
i also like kids...but i'm not one.
it's not just a guy thing.
well, like i wouldn't necessarily just drop my friend like just because we fight.
do you see yourself happy for the rest of your life with this person?
think why you guys broke up and then you move on too.
go where ur p leads u mayb even in the wrong direction!
i need advice from other ppl.
dump the one you have (trust me: she'd be shocked!
then a personality that isn't too bad.
i dont think that girls are bad liars.
well it creeps me out but some people get intense pleasure from it...go figure
its only normal to cool off i guess.
you need to ask yourself if you like him!
doesn't sound like a good mate to me.. but that's just me.
if you like guys and girls, then you are bi.
he should have the heart not play w/ _num_ heart.
first, choose only one guy, you love.
but men are people to and have feelings just like us ladies do.
i can't think of any reasons.
i wouldn't want my guy having lunch with some other lady on v-day!
many reasons for marriage break ups, money, kids, infidelity, stress, family
also for older kid, try putt putt golf, laser tag, go-karts, that kind of thing.
i loved my boyfren of _num_ years.
i really mature for my age too.
when you find your gem hopefully he'll want you for you
she is the boss, and you had an intimate interlude with her -that is that.
the problem is, how can i say no and still remain good friends?
you will always wonder if you never tell him the truth
make it slow and steady... opss i'm a man...
straight up tell them and at the right moment.not whn there is a bunch of ppl around
good things come to those who wait.
show her she's important and not your stupid friends
hmmm well _num_ no its not always bout the outside of a woman!
but hes as clueless as i am.
i have been nothing but nice to her everyday....what should i do?
what kind of father does that make him???
if she breaks ur heart its not my fault, you shouldn't have listened _num_ my advice.
i loved this guy but after he humiliated me in front of _num_ ppl, i dunno wat i feel!!
maybe the both of you need time apart.
an easy way of saying he just wants to be a booty call.
or just excited about being in love?
if he wants to be friends thenso be it.
have u ever wondered why they have to fight?
because that is all they ever thing about...
we're not mind readers you know...
sometimes guys say that stuff to play you.
umm..prolly because you're single and couldn't get a date??
if you get tied up in mess your going to come out with mess.
oh forgot a big one for you ladies.....ever use the sample cosmetics at the mall?
or, one day, slap him with a kiss!
and depends on if he likes war games or sports or role playing ect...
all guys do it even when they're married
i love to dream, about different men, i guess it's okay.
but you'll never catch a woman admitting to it!
if you asking this it means that you love your wife.
well... if he doesn't even know who you are it looks really hard... but it is worth trying
brush your mouth twice..there will be no trouble..
because some guys tottally lose their brain when they are around hot grl like me :)
if not no if your to young like _num_ and younger then no.
what to do is simple know her/his emotions and talk about such emotion things
ya the moneys is great but there alot of stuff in those places .
it just depends on how it is.
you won't meet anyone too serious unless you got a big dick.
it that true i tryed taking to him but he wont return my calls.
and tell them how sad you are.
come to romania with me, i already live there:)!
you wake up and one day just know.
they're happy, so it could work for you too!
believe me, you do not mess with a friend's younger sister.
if all you want is to be with him, stay with him.
lets talk on yahoo shrunkenmann_thegrass (_num_ girls only)
she really looks up to u and thinks of you as a friend and probly nothing more
i wouldn't worry about the embarrasment factor there.
oh yes, if you realy feel the need to..send him one too.
youhave some work to do there.
have a serious talk with and tell her that it is childish and you are getting older.
comunication but are you sure u wanna do that
now if you can't say this to his face scream it in the mirror with him not around...know why?
as for what to do... dont do anything.
no only if they are sick
and if not, you will show him how.
).....i am looking for virgin girl as i havent sex yet.
yeah your mom is going out with him
he will love you so much more ...
but if you think that this could lead you to a heartbreak then wait and watch what happens!!
he must have been a friend at one time.
the phrase to use is, hey, i got enuff friends
first of all she,s not much of a best friend, keep your eye on her.
try yahoo personals to see if you like some guy.
then tell him that if he's interested, u could go out sometime.
stare at that for a bit.
maybe my mother, but that's another story!
you might be too hot for your own good.
go on a cruise and push her overboard.
dont push her or tell her you love her.
but thats not a bad thing if you enjoy it and its with a responsible person.
beause they dont think with the head on their sholders.
believe in yourself...it is very sexy!
i have dated several bi females and its a turn on bigtime!!!
if i really think about it i want to be with both of them i guess.
no, it just like he loves exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
both if i have to choose only one then beauty for this moment
i say.... that whatever your instinct tells you is happening....is happening.
so i guess a little of both
make love with a loved one .
yeah like lumbeeman said, have your bff tell him for you
yes he is a man that is what we do!
but everytime i get back its the same crap over again.
just try to let him know you!
you don't know what real problems are until you get married and have kids!
that is a lie if you really love the person your relationship will stay strong no matter what
so we always meet and i feel like him.
maybe he's just checkin' if you're alright.
with love will be full of sweet meanings
sure, feel free to chat me up anytime.....
your still going to feel you can not trust men.
you can't really expect to give him anything too pricey!
believe wat u want _num_ blive.
well, i would date a girl who was stripper, because i don't matter who she was.
sense of humor is very important
he says he respects tht i wanna wait and undetrsatnds!!
i thought this boy liked me he used to stare at me all day long.
but if ur ok w/ it, and it should b ok!
just assure her that mom/dad both love her very much even tho mom/dad don't live together anymore.
u will prove to be a great sis!!!
i guess people want what they can't have.
you can like who ever u like
you should definately tell her to wait.
tell ur partnner and undetstand him well, help ur self to help each other.
hubby & i got married in july (_num_-_num_-_num_) and went to hawaii for _num_ weeks!
because if you're not, it will be dry sex and will hurt.
wat do i do with both of them?
unless you absolutley love it i would say no!
there are men who don't care at all about what they look like.
where do u want it to go?
maybe its because he is not lonely.
if u have an he still continues to do it then let him go u dont need that!!
how much success you get in your life and you find love is the reason for that success
try being the women then i am sure ull find one.
does anybody know what love is any more.
you urinate from there, and don't even wipe!
any guy that's not completely desperate won't ask you out again if you dumped him.
we try to make females comfortable.
or if i see you with another girl, i'll rip her bloody arms off.
you need to get a job if you asking questions like that.
and ask yourself if he is a decent person and is nice.
i have a friend who had the hood of her clitoris pierced very very cool
so how do i approch a woman and ask her to come home with me and my b/f?
then you kno wat to do......forgive.
no everything everyone else said is true also.
i dont care if your a virgin if you are slutty that matters i dont want vd
tell her while in a middle of a conversation to surprise her
if he does that means he really cares for you.
as long as u r true.true love u will find anywhere.
see if she emails you back or find out in person.
easier to move on,two wrongs don't make a right.
tell them that they will never get anywhere in life by being a liar!
dogs r like family(trust me i know.
only if your heart desires to, if your gut says run then do so
and of course stop & say hey!
if they are hurting themselves too much to listen tho..find another adult.... a grandparent?
i know a women who was married to a jerk and he beat their kids.
cos dey have a guilty conscience
and after the police left the dog was in custidy and the kids were back in bed.
stop doing this then if she is not willing
i sure would like to talk to someone
yes, like you are a complete stranger to me.
i don't think most guys are stupid.
well, if you are a girl and you like a lesbian, then you are a lesbian!
even if what he is saying is true- why would he text message other girls asking for naked pictures?
i love my ex with all my heart.
dont tell him first, go to your mom or school social worker and let them talk to your parents.
it's not as difficult if you know what your doing.
if it's love, then he will wait and also not cheat on you
make them laugh and they'll love u.
men like this are a waste of scum!
unless if you like being treated like poop.
i would not like to be the _num_ guy if she thinks about the _num_
im getting _num_ this coming august _num_ _num_ thats true
this is the love most people seek, yet are to lazy to earn it.
maybe because they knew you would be furiouse.
just talk to her and see if she does like you.
lmao, great way to start the day, lol
i gave him a second chance but he didnt take.
if she wants to, she will when shes free.
lights on and on top is sexy!
be friend and give him some timen space
...you're starting to hate the male/female friends of the one you love.
do something that most people haven't.
i dont believe that love dies so fast.
ok, i think its just nothing.
she's still probably living w/ her parents
this is a major no, no!
any way she is still with you so obversly she does .
i wouldn't worry about things like that!
sounds like he's playing hard to get...and you aren't.
i'm not sure even chickens care about it thats what
you get out what you put in (no pun intended)
soap if you smell better maybe.....
just move on ... think about how lucky you are to not be with him!!
what can i do to get her to lose weight?
leave him, he is not worth your time
a lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
if he gets too possesive send him packing.
when you can hear echother without speaking
you should try it some time you will not be dissapointed
i mean.how insensitive of her to do those things infront of you!!duh?
other than that, go to a party and hit on drunk chicks.
and just ask him, it might be awkward but it will be worth it if he does love you.
say i love you if its meant to be it will just come out
it will pay off in the long run.
i am always into the a-hole guys, whats my problem?
would i pack my husband's bags?
then you don't have a relationship.
why my ex b/f keeps tryin to make me jealous..
my best friend is a guy and we have never tried to be more
in my case though, it didn't!
hang around with her,go shopping if she likes it,.
nope he has a lady sorry,
if you love a boy then tell hem
my dad is like that too.
he needs to grow up and mature
i'm not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
so, #_num_ - boys say things they don't really mean.
just find other girl, she dont love you
marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
and really get to know her.
i'm married with one child and i want to be single again.
find a new man if you care that much
you deserve someone that will not listen to other people without asking you first !!!
(at least of course if you are over _num_!)
he was like hey baby whats happnin'.
and you already had sex with this man.
well you can apologize,, but you can't have him back,, just accept what you already decided...
try watching an adult movie together.
after you ask the gal, y u dont like me.
but she has a boyfriend so dont make a move.
but yes it could work if you want it to!
it's too late, you missed your chance, and she has moved on now.
you know your in love if u have sex with them
because after all i'm in your school.
;) come on ladies- tell him!
just be patient dont' rush your self.
i heard once it was not.
and stay away from the plants i mentioned.
people are just plain dumb .
it could never be boring thing
i've been with my husband since i was _num_ and i'm going to be _num_ next month.
never buy a women lingere unless it is something she wants.
dude same here.. but i don't think its a bad choice...
i asked her to dance and we are now friends.
either that or u try to find his other self and accept him.
if ha can't respect you then he's got to go!!
very truly speaking, wether my friends agree or not, they cannot ever find a friend like me.
instead of telling him -show him what you like...
you do not find her it will just happen.
you do understand they're just using you, don't you?
and since you aren't even sure, then you know it isn't worth it.
i'd marry your cat just to get in the family!
before too long..>>>>> you sucked them into your blackhole of lovin!
i'm right here baby, all you gotta do is ask
get buck wild have sex anywhere and everywhere.
good luck buddy you will need it.
it is not right, and is it legal?
my sister has dumbed him since then but she is pregnant with his baby.
yeah baby.. a girl knows what a irl wants right???
he even slept with his best friends wife.
or do you enjoy hurting those that mean so much to you.
it's pretty much up to you to decide you don't want to be miserable anymore.
i wouldnt want or need anyone else.
something that happened behind your back.
become a friend to a women first.
he probably won't tell you, but he's most likely to tell _num_ else.
because when you are into a relationship, and if you go out for fun... this kills your partner.
he is a piece of shit and i never want to see him agen.
she might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around, etc., but she can't fake that.
maybe you have but u dnt knw it
just don't go overboard with all your planning!
we get along great except this issue.
time to move on to a differnet place ?
well ask him or ask ur friends that know him and they might know.
tell him that you are a beautiful vampire ;))
the coaches were more laid back and i usually played over half the game.
thay left us know choice but to part.i never stop loving him.
start by saying i want to kiss you here (nose) then here (mouth) and here (cheek) then here (neck)!
girl, don't tell him you want to make love to him!
i dont know... are you in love?
wait, it will be well worth it.
i dont think u should give him any more times u dont wanna get hurt again
he'll find that with another, but you want something more, don't you?
make them want to break up with you.
if he loves you, he will be heartbroken, but he will get over it.
u shouldn't be with no man who gonna keep pushin u to do things u don't want to.
some guys that have experience don't know which way is up.
hook up with math geeks, they know how to handle curves :-)
you have to basically overdose to get off.
if you have tried to hard!
what was that about now i am curious too.
a upclass strip bar with losts of beer
yes i would, in a heart beat!
here is not the place to find one
yes dude, if you start lifting your a** off that chair!
but that also depends on who you are??
yes, at least mine do live.
cauze if you never give it a chance u will never know what would had happen between yall _num_
i have never heard of a guy who didn't like this.
obviously if he's going through all that trouble to scare you he doesn't want you.
things like this are bad to do thru email
well, why did you post such a stereotypical, dumb and pointless question?
i just wanna help her open up her eyes before something bad happens....
thats not very fair to the guy your seeing now.
they want a man just to be himself, at least i do
is it just too weird and geeky!
wow.... what a situation..... good luck with that!
is not bad, if you like him.
he could be just using you for just sex.
i'm sorry if you love him (wait you said that you didn't) anywho, leave him please!
you have ever right to be mad
but send the ole boy a post card from bora bora or something.
maybe you should tell her and see what response you get.
why would you care, as long as you got yours...right?
i _num_ agree with u there.
a hard face _num_ go wit it.
ive asked her to be my girl friend _num_ times already but she never answers.
got anything better to do the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
ya i care, but its not everything
hey, i am _num_ and just got a girl friend.
just ask him or tell him u luv him n ask him _num_ b ur boyfren
no, this is not bad at all.
because u already know so much about oneanother.
i never talk bad about any person.
okay youre confusing _num_ question at a time.
cheat on her with a hooker they have experience
not only men have them, women can too
#_num_ - don't use sex as a weapon in your marraige
that way you get to sample other women and it's not cheating.
what happend to his queen kong?
mabey but ill never find him
do not do it in private.
who cares wha their gender is.
shower, wear deodorant & always have fresh breath...
no matter if your in a skirt and heals or a baggy pair of jeans.
dude, go back to lickin yer nuts.
he used to mentally and physically abuse me.
i have gone out with big guys.
do you have a chicken butt?
if you like her ask her out and see where it takes you
tell your man, to tell him that u don't like that guy.
no guy wants to be just friends with women.
or what do you think about marriage?
yet i will not date a large man.
but try to stay out of this till time makes them calm;) good luck
sex and candy where can i find you?
its better to loose a lover than love a looser
well if a guy does that to me, i just move on.
alright, the way it's always worked for me is to go out with a friend.
first off, don't do anything you don't want to.
as gab said...no way to know.
your a _num_ year old woman you should look for someone your around age
don't push the ladies... they don't respond well.
why dont you call her.send some valentines card!
you mite lose the one you love,to some- one else.
my bffl went ut w/ a really short guy and they even kissed.
i'm _num_ :-) would anybody lie about that age ?
what exactly do guys want from girls?
lastnight when me and my ex talked i asked him that question!
if he is a nice guy, he'll understand and probablly stop if he likes you.
ank one other thing, trust her.
just surprise him...... you can do it!
just wait... maybe its yet the time for you to meet the right one
no it s not noemal it is abnormal
im comfused wot was u askin?
if he did, he wouldn't have even looked at the other girl.
if i could arrange the alphabet i would put u next to i.
personally can't even think of going out with someone i gave the boot to bf.
why do married /committed men cheat?
afterall she has lived her life all these days jus _num_ u...
where the heck do you live?
it seem's from your statement, your just hangin on to a dream... dr checko... (nickname)
who can put me back together
u should ask a person u trust or a doctor.
any person hu loves u shud think think about your feelings.
where does the baby's daddy fit in?
you shouldnt get with your cousin.
my love... aka my girlfriend aka my everything aka shes perfect...
guys can have female friends too -
you might even find that you dont like being sexual with a woman at all.
however i think stupid far excedes dumb.
because once they are interested then the chase is over
and why would you go with somebody that young or old
wellllll some guy's butts are cute.
if he is trying to control you - get out!!
if you truly like this person, then why not give it a try?
no, drop dead girl who dumped me....i even won't give a damn to her anymore....
no dought about it im positive!
i think 'no answer' is your answer, you just don't want to admit it.
sweetie, love conquers all...what are you so worried about?
never can be if ur a teen or kid or something........
pick em up round midnite at the nursing home and go to wendys lol
i love my bf/childs father to death!
bear in mind, that this guy hadn't been in a relationship for almost _num_ years!
read this article and say whatever you can to stop her!!!
rather say, whos on yer mind...
many men are totally happy just keep sex interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it
just them down and explain to them they should be understanding , and support u no matter what .
i'm just his friend, i mean, i love him and as far as i know, he has no idea.
and you have a problem with this?
step _num_: if you don't see any result after _num_ weeks.
i have id in yahoo with camera.
the guy is married for god's sake!
and its usually the one who is not as good in bed as the other.
it is never boring it's actually fulfilling
lights off w/ very few candles and on top of the covers
oh yes you can.....where were you that day in sex ed?
so here, take it, but don't take it for granted.
if they dont then they arent worth you caring what they think
but why would he ignore me??
i think a guy with a nice round butt is sexy.
i have guy friends that are like brothers to me and there's no tension whatsoever.
i here a coat hanger and a vacuum will do the job
u should have a nice impression on the girl .
gather all ur girlfrends & have a party.. let her mingle w/new faces..
ur spellings tell how worried u r.
sounds like you are hot, so thats a good start!
nobody can do it better than you
you are such green minded people!!!
just remember alot of married men are very happy.
but don't be like are you a virgin.
ya know i have the same problem, so i know what ya mean.
girls sorry this looser said that about you the rest of us think your all great
never mind what anyone else wants!
so what do u want to do now?
you really need to learn to read a person, you know?
guy: im a caveman girl:whats this?
yes get rid of the cat.
just get it over with and text him.
or just my guy ego cant handle a girl knowin about it !
if you have money to spend, girls usually love jewelry!!
if she like the beach maybe a weekend in the bahamas.
this my opinion,that's whow i think about this!
if you don't like any of the guys that asked you out then just say no.
it can be very sexy to watch a woman... and yo might get a pointer or two...
do it in person though, set up a dinner date.
u dont take any precaution and u get pragnent
he's ignoring u for the same reasons we ignore you!
!lol when i went out there i noticed that too.
im _num_ years old.im almost handsome.
tell her to try asking him out or something.
ur question is making ppl able to know that u r single.
bro's before ho's...ok, so your girls, the saying still works.
i would not give my life up for a stranger or a friend.
people dont care anymore about others.
and u tell him it's ur way or no way.
call and say hello and be done with it one way or another
put your nose into her p...!
she's just not that into you.
like me my luv lives far away from me.
what in gods name are you doing.
don't let her play games with you.
it cant be love because you dont know anything about her!
it is better and easier to tell over the phone or in person.
you won't find love on the internet
u cant put ur life to be all about her.
its simple that u should take her out for dating .
jus t tell them u already have a date sorry about that you should have asked earlier
easy _num_ for me and -_num_ for u
once i just said, well, if there's nothing better to do .
she might have an underlieing factor that makes her eat this much ?
step _num_: if she is pregnant then end of procedure.
you sneeky bugger..i was just going to ask this question.
probably the one thing that comes before good health on the human scale of existance!
women likes to be pampered,take her to dinner or order in candles, flowers,just treat her like a queen.
i think so for romantic love plus its really fun
so wht to ddo you think!
not special, not weird... just your personal choice.
can u check it out for me plz die fast
the question is the other way around how do get your guy to back off the girl.
i went to one where they had a belly dancer instead...lame!
she already knows it not love.
i wouldn't worry about the heroin.
i like to laugh and tell jokes!
it cant be done,if they care about you its going to hurt no matter how you say it.
wat are you good at doing?
someone else might take the opportunity.........don't be late.
if they r not, why would be so mean?
start cutting him off now -- that way when you get married, he'll be used to it
just say 'i love you' getting him/her off guard.
he obviouly doesnt accept u for u so how can u stay with him no piont in being miserable.
i believe that they will.why not?
because once you cross the friendship line it's really hard to go back to that!
i think that boys are more sensitive but girls show it more.
gave: get a life... and relax.
so just go ahead and text!!
dont stick with someone who isnt right for you, its just not worth it.
dont belive in it at all....its too commercialized!!
he is only using you ?
one might b good n bed, the other a listener!
you got that right .but have to do it any way .or she kill me.
it what u make of it.
why is he sleeping out with the dog?
do you dream about her at night?
so, i guess you just have to circulate the places,activities you enjoy, strike up conversation,and see what happens...
no, i don't want to shake your hand either
if you truly in love you dont want anything else.
sweet heart i love you so much.
pick yourself up, don't let it bother you too much, and just have fun/play the field.
i think she likes me because of the flirting, and person talk that goes on, between us.
relax, do it and think that's not the best point in your life.
it wouldn't matter how she looks.
being _num_ years old is pure hell isn't it??
he will ask you to marry him.
then go ask her out,, :)
hmmm, a little vague on the informastion giving.
of course i have plenty of friends who are guys......yet i have plenty of friends that are girls.
(and i hope things turn out right..)
seriously, laize faire answer tone from now on...
as they get married they syart acting stupid and abusive.
chances are only once in a blue moon!!!
whats the worst thing they can say?
and my guess is that he wants you to have phonsex with him... but maybe you don't?!
are u implying there is something not good about me???!
did you just read what you wrote.
and trust me priorities is a big quality to look for!
they dont see them, they feel them
especially if u are looking to get married and settle down.
took my neighbor (who doesn't drive) to the doctors at _num_ last night after work .
please her in the bed room also.
just tell her that you need a hug every once in a while.
if a guy didn't really care, he wouldn't give a damn.
(no offense to big butts, but it was a man).
trust me you can't change them!
it depends u have to ask him first
no way to know her virginty, untill you not fucked her so don't wait do it fast.
satisfy ur self but be careful use protection!!
some men just need a little extra stimulation to ... ahem, get the job done.
i tell my guy that i love him every day.
what is a gurl to do?
because all men love to compete.
you marry the one you can't live without.
wanna have girl frnds or boy frnds?????
and dear as i believe sex is to b done to give satisfaction not to get.. unselfishly.
adam and eve.... they were smart tho
for some guys does it not always matter just about the sex?
my guess is you dont look the same to her either if you dont inspire her to inpress you.
you never know, try flirting with girls...that helps
yes, i really think there's hope.
new boyfriend, your a girl it should be easy
maybe u just need mr.just for me
the way she reponds will tell you if she right for you or not.
if you cant to the time [haveing a baby] then dont do the crime [haveing sex]
well, i'd believe what the girl said to you.
if ur hot also comment on her hair,outfit,or her shoes.
once u've talked to her then decide where u are going to live.
being a lesbian/gay is not cool.
sex plus friend does not always equal love to both men and women.
at least he wants you involved in it!
do they feel like he doesn't have confidence or something
gosh...i love my sister to death, but she always seems to put herself in unhealthy relationships.
you dont know... that's why they call it love (confusin aint it)
he even accepted my newborne daughter as his own.
if u wana attract ur husband's attention and #@$#)*)#)_*, then u gotta remember two words; food and sex.
if you watched spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off gaurd and just lay it on him
as thick as you want it.
and don't think you won't be getting pleasure from it.
it should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you.... go for it!!
if you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
you have been hanging around with the wrong women.
never hide........... u might just loose them.
if you feel shy, just tell him to close his eyes.
who needs gud looks if he acts like a beast???
i'd go wit jamookae ,hz gt serious emotional issues!
and you might have already scared her.
let me guess: move to new zealand?
tell him ur boss or just dump him and get anouther man in ur life
personality above all... then fit body (and not neccessarily thin) and kindness...
we're all a little screwy round here!
your mom kicked the wrong person out.
so if you havent slept together yet...don't.
to start having boyfrends _num_ but datng like going on dates _num_
by the way he looks at you and act towards you.
my dad lost about _num_ pounds just by playing out side.
if these don't work out, leave things as they were, and start anew in a different direction!
no...why can't a guy talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
it means exactly what she says.
now im at _num_ and single.
far enough to be away from family but close enough so they can visit maybe once a month?
say hi, then just have casual conversation with him.
they need to compete to be the biggest loser on earth
who knows what a woman is doing when she's not with you, trust her or leave her
i advise u dont hold anything bak.
i am trying to think what is on my mind, that's what :)
i don't really even like the word stupid .
yea my ex said the same thing once.
a dance is just a dance.
you have a bf that loves you and you love him too right?
if you are not married and have sex, its bloooody and hurrrty.
go to a very important (in her life) vacation resort
of course, if it feels right.
you seem like a sweet person...you can find better!
abbout _num_ to _num_ hunred is my gguess
i am to busy to respond to that.. #_num_ would be....
some men just don't function the same.
of course she yelled about it then.
i'm telling you, it was long.
tell your lover how special they are to you & why.
i made it and so can you.
if they dodge the question and/or get angry then i would be worried.
lol i supposed you've tried talking to him?
a lot of girls like it when you make eye contact.
yes find your next boyfreind .dam there are alot of lonly peoples out there move on
i kind of have a mix between the two.
its coo when ur in like _num_ grade???
remember the good times and forget the bad but it takes time
well i think you should introduce your self.
kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her!
it once happened to me man.
because you're the only ten i see!
how can i tell if the man im with truely loves me
its not bad, but it does look kind of funny if the girl is significantly taller
no they cant because somewhere deep down there is a attraction,,,,,,,,
why in the world would you do something like that and then go around telling it???
if someone doen't ask you out, does that mean that you are unattractive or something????
you know what, love finds you so don't rush things out ok?
my problem is i make girls angry because i'm smarter than them.
and u kno wat he doin but u don't care cuz u let him tell ya different.
i think it depends on hwo mature the child is.
i say think long and hard about it.
oh, also tell your man why u hated him.
i understand that u feel as though shes not as attractive, but shes happy bout the way she feels.
i can fall in love after one month.
kinda like suicide... normal to think about, but not to do.
move on and stalk someone else.
i don't want him as a boyfriend anymore.
so how can i tell him?
really though, they are just bad news.
i kinda like my guys thick.
just have fun or keep yourself busy.
how to check that i am madly in love with her ...?
you can do alot of things.
guys likes my butt and always whistling at my butt.. lucky me, i guess!
now the devils hell hounds are tracking his every step.
then see what she says, and you'll have your answer
is he ruining his life or what?
yep, some are way out there.hello.
i guess becuase they are loved, if not they wouldn't find it.
it will bring him down and probably not want to have sex with you agian.
see u ve decided to leav ur wife.
because they are not happy missing somthing from their relationship
but, still wants to have sex with you.
i'd never pack my husband's bag!
well if you really love her, this will happen for sure.
with kids its not so simple.
most people don't believe in it until they fall, and fall hard.
its not bad if you laugh at yourself.
ha ha, have a delightful day.
ask him if he'd like to go somewhere with you.
and me im also mexican but not mixed.
i knew it is hard but is better for you.
it just depend on how old you are
she's not interested, or maybe you came on too strong.
don't do something u'll regret later!
sorry i dont know where to find him...
!and there are alot of other guys on this planet.
no, unless you feel you need to doubt that.
they don't do anything for me....
it's odd that someone so young is on here answering questions...
that will cost you _num_ points per answer :)
y do it matter to u?
if you want drinks there, make it byob.
see...marriage is not fun and games.
mayb thier hubbys are not good enough....
find out if hes cheating on you?
have you two been hanging out with your parents?
a woman wants an honest guy.
_num_, almost _num_ how old are you?
its is wet and so cool and better if its forbiden
you can say it but whether you mean it or not is whats to be questioned...
he wouldn't think twice about not using a condom).
he broke up with you because of what someone else said!
first of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
sometimes yah...but you dont know if its real love
being good all the time is boring.
step _num_: do it _num_ times a day.
perhaps a little narcissistic, maybe, but probably not gay...you just like the sight of, well, yourself.
if he doesn't, kick his butt.
u are just jealous of those other people holding hands and making out because you can't get a guy!!!
my grandmother tells this story better!
i see him once in a while and i made the right decision.
but forgot to bring some for me .
and why did they not tell you.
unless the chick didn't care if i slept with other hoes.
the more you think about here the more you want here.
ask the girl to go to the dance.
find a girl that share the same intrest you do
and that he has a tiny wiener.
i'm sorry dude, but that's disgusting.
please leave her go on with your life.
i've heard of friends that start going out and find out they were eant to be.
nope customer care took it off of the answers......bummer
it's a way _num_ show u that she doesnt want _num_ attract any other guys..
i don't know...if i were you, i'd ask her whether or not she likes you
just be yourself and like the first guy said, a little money wont hurt anyone.
do u think she should ask d guy??
yes, the butt is an important physical feature on a guy that makes him attractive.
first kiss send my head spining for a few second.
if he says sure hye's not cheating.
yes, so that i can do the same to her!
nope.unless they actually said we're back on, then nope.
dont make it look like you are attacking her weight she will just shut down and probably eat more.
thats wrong to the person that said women commit because of money.
any chance they'd like each other as well?
be yourself and if they dont like you for that they dont deserve you
your daughter comes first in all aspects of your life no matter what!
then, he broke up with me after a few days!!!
a person is there when u are happy and when u are sad.
do i walk away or stay around????
chear up..things will get better,,trust me..
may-b you become clingy after sex and it scares men away.
do not fall totally in love with him.
wow thats really sad...were do you live???
if you dont mind being her backup then okay.
i wish u da best do watz right even though it might hurt.
some girls like to please their man so nobody has to.
u are making issues with him.
i think playing hard-to-get is your best bet!
and then again there are the homophpobics.
)i want respect and i want him to be nice.
anyone who 'doesn't get it' is brainwashed.
stopped a kid from j walking / running accrost the street in the rain.
i think its alot important .
u need to ask him directly, if he wants to spend the rest of his life with u.
hey be yourself if she dont like you then move on you are still young
um o let me think noooo.get real this isnt a chat room
you will find the one that is for you.
sex, u don't have to kiss, but u have to have sex.
get rid of cat,steam clean carpet,furniture,bed linen, spray for ticks&fleas
so look at those girls in the eyes and dont look away
he believes she would not cheat on him but just hates this and it drives him crazy.
it really depends on the situation...
hugging him was probably not the best solution, lol.
and stop letting your hubby be such a slacker!
yes u could fall in love after _num_ months trust me it happen to me
(throws bananna at the screen and scratches head)..lol..just kidin.
go and have ur breast treated and get them reduced and look sexy
if they love each other they will live together
(in the future: don't ask such stupid questions.)
my friend always teases for who i am!
move on - time is essence
just ask her if she ever have sex with anyone.
and she dont want other people to say anything.
once by mistake i had proposed her and she had accepted.
flirt and find out u never know to u try
congratulation to him and his bride, she is lucky :-)
sounds like you not or you would be asking.
perhaps... but obviously not enough feeling for her to leave his wife.
all i know is i am with you there!
but i have my own opinions too :p
sex is serious and dirty, making love is fun.
say a prayer to help u guide the best possibilities.. people come and go in ur life.
love is not rare dont worry and dont be the bit*ch ok?
if he says no he's cheating.
i was chatting wit a guy _num_ hrs.
not just honest but honorable........... ie not a cheater or player
and he broke up with me.
tell him what you want, basicly, and lead him,
be honest with yourself and who you are.
and also the penis story as well.lol
ur not on jerry springer now
i know, it's easier said than done.
if u were to fall in love with a girl, would it be her: personality?
do u mean how are u?
the world is full of fucking guys ...
it's kind of weird for him probably.
if so why can't it make it?
here's the answer that life is great!
if he is doing it by choice that should be questioned and watched very closely
i miss him.... if anyone out there know this guy please email me.........
ask her if she likes ya
don't go to youre best friends house when he's aorund, or if you do make sure she's aorund too.
if you like him then of course you should continue, why wouldn't you?
don't spend a lot of money.
and if you are not ready to becoming a mom, start prtecting yourself from getting pregnant...
start from the day of your wedding.
forget the text stuff just call him at home.
one more thing- don't listen to these women.
yes you should, give him his walking papers.
well, if she dumped you because you were just being you then.
phone sex is like an alternative from doing the real thing.
marry her and go to the court.
just where ever you go give her the best of the best!
- if your a woman: dress up & act ladylike.
im pretty or so guys tell me.
they are not good to have around babies they have dieases.
i think u should just write him a note
mayhaps you should travel to the uk and find this out.
i'm married, trust me i know.
no, because it complicates things a lot.
idk y r u askin me
well, if he makes you happy and you make him happy, then go for what you know!!!
babe, he is the one who doesn't love you!!
i think that ne younger then _num_ or _num_ is stupid.
that is just how you know it jut comes to you and thn youll know!
if not, stay with your sister!
first off, are you a guy, girl, or somewhere in between?
well just like me _num_ years ago.
to show their apreciation and to make it known that they think of you and they care for u.
we are married but still she cant conceive...pls advise..
i would tell him straight up,he probably won't care anyway.
it's all the inside that matters
perhaps she doesn't brag about him to her friends the way she used to.
okay, so he likes to flirt and he's good looking.
you like him, but you call him a creepy guy?
who knows , and let the people alone
plz tell me the possiability to be pregnant in this satuation
there's hot and awesome guys that weigh over _num_!
take a hint, she doesn't want you.
a man can work from sun to sun, but a womens job is never done!
many men are, but all men are not.
you're a threat alright, you just don't know it yet.
i would have to agree with _num_
of course.i would go.i do not have to be a muslim to attend such a wedding!
oh god, try talking to him first.
please, send me some more info if you need help ;-)
sorry if i'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
yes you can fall in love after _num_ mönths , it could be .
tell your friend to tell him that you like him.
since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
well u cant take the baby back!
it's a beautiful thing to still have your innocence don't ever feel bad about that.
he needs an incentive (although you should be the incentive, but some men are jerks like that).
another girl likes the guy that i do, and i feel like i don't stand a chance.
just like she did to you.
everything, a woman wants everything from a man!!!
i'm in junior high and he is in highschool but he is a junior!
or, you could always ask him.
a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
and u just wanna be urself.
when you're both naked and in bed together
but it has to be up to you.
most of tha time i think about it and say well is it realy my choice !
what's the opposite of above me?
how about all the women that cheat.
wow, alot of my friends' girlfriends ask me this same question.
but i agree that the guy you are asking about was just a dog!
i know it sucks now but you'll get over him.
whatever you do, just make sure you are not caught up in their fights.
wow, what an ego you have.
are you kidding me right now?
if u are in luv u will never feel boared....thats true luv my frind.
i don't want her to die.
just be careful when you do it!
now, would i put myself in danger for a friend or stranger...?
if i got that same kiss today i'd be very dissapointed.
and neither of us could think of anything better to do!
i want work to be over with today and forever!
flirt with him/her and tell her you ove her/him
otherwise its just something else that may lead to love you never know
do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
we'd go for walks, & she'd whine.
no,becuase he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
either he loves you or he doesn't...
he's already got a girlfriend it sounds like.
no its not boring to fall love.
simply because u only put _num_ of ur effort.
instinctly, i'm going to say yes.
a nice yard wedding worked for me.
i dont think i have a chicken butt.
then most likely you are stuck in the friend zone if that anymore... sorry.
wait so he doesnt have a reason to hate you
but smart peeps aren't a lil too smart.
hell, the other saturday morning, i had to pretend to be a shemale like _num_ times!
i don't know, i think it is mixed.
never mind, i tried it doesn't work.
because if you go down that road and bail on him later, that would truly suck!
if you aer under _num_ and stell in school you do not want to have sex.
or shell break it off to make a move.
give her one in front of everybody and see what she does
he is getting married to a women right?
maybe one day they will be conviced.
know anyone who can make a cake...there you go!
so should i tell my man that i don't like being around him?
why did you leave home the first time?
no,just leave him like a dog and he'll know how good you are!!
i don't like seeing her ribs though, sorry supermodels.
do not know, except that i am not on the list.
cause most guys are laing dogs
women can be friends, but men can't....................
when she not asking you for any, any more!
at least that way i'd get into her.
or like what you did for class....?
its exciting, especially when you have the butterflies in your stomach!
_num_ months if you want to go in the poor house.
that said, just because everyone is dating and you aren't doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with you.
lol is short for laughing out loud.
the more that you keep giving him the more he is gonna take.
?i think infatuation is only for months...
depend on the girl if she likes your buutt she will take care of it
if i wanted it, i wouldnt only want it once.
different men like different things...i know guys that like big girls (i also know some that don't).
make it look like u want her like something else.
it is all about that dollar!
i`m sure he will be happy.
i mean insider pain, man are not strong they are tough.
only if she's hotter than me.
i wanna help but i'm too lazy to read it
don't try to ignore or play cool.
it hurts extremaly bad and it is better to wait untill u are marryed and do that
i'm _num_ you serious about your age????????
you are not her type and i believe she is not also your type.
don't let him use you ...and by that i mean - think about your self.
are they sick or wonderful.plz elaborate and answer me
because the boys get gelles that you like hin not me
if u really like her it shouldnt matter at all.
the ones just out of the blue are truely given from the heart!!
there is this girl at my school and shes really nice.
if you know any, please recommend me, thanks
no offense to any good men out there
my mom's boyfriend and i always argue.
were not getting any younger, that is the adveture in life.
i've been hanging out with this really hott guy and we are getting closer and closer every day.
stand on a chair or walk on stilts!
if u like sports play vball or bball or whatever!
of his life, and he would never cheat on me.
im sorry if i got the point wrong.
or if you're too shy, get involved in things she likes, even if you hate it.
she's realised what shes thrown away, and can see how happy you are.
start commenting him on his looks!
the dress, and brides maids dresses might take you a month alone lol
maybe the same way you told us!
you daughter is acting stupid and you should tell her so, then shut up.
he didn't think about u at all.
no they will not go to heaven.
all depends on so many factors, such as mood...
i'm a boy, wanna go out with me?
good luck and i hope he catches on and asks you out!
let things go as they are going.
you need to sign another one every day with each other.
and the only reason i did that is because i didnt want to feel lonely.
i have a friend who shops there for that reason!
(think about what that makes you look like to his friends?
do a good deed every day!
your damb right you did the right thing!
haven't done that but i mean.. think i'd either start laughing or get way too distracted
i wouldn't want my wife to have a sexual affair.
you don't need all girls to like you--just one.
no matter what stand up for your self.
know a lot of girls here in the philippines that met someone online and got married.
if he is joking about liking you, then forget him!
we have _num_ children under _num_, so it's not like i can play with him for very long.
my guy has an awesome butt because he works out.
so looking at other women, flirting with other women isn't cool.
ask from ur sister she give sutiable answer to u
the same problem is with me
not necessary but it helps a lot!!!
if your over him it shows.
i think you need to talk to yer cousin.
i think it would be cool.
women are different, just like men are.
i know a lot of decent guys.
a girl that has a sluty mind set but isnt one u know
probably so couldn't stay away from eachother long!
it kinda depends though when you are older
you say ur sexy and stylish?
you are living in a fantasy
lot thoughts coming while going to bed.
don't marry that girl at all, she is using you.
okay, most of the girls in your campus hate him.
people freaked out about that, but i'm glad i married him.
in my daddy's world, my mama was.
dont ever ever fall for that garbage.
there are some great looking young _num_ year old men; but why not look for younger men!!
the girl you like is going to be alone and she says that sucks.
then.....he tried to kill himself and my stupid butt went to see him in the hospital.
hook/ kiss up with the guy in front of that girl.
_num_) if you date trash, you'll marry trash.
but this really depends on her.
a girl can be pretty no matter what size she is.
cos one way or another shes gonna find out if we got to bed together!
then if he still wants to be friends only.
she a player all she wants is a boy toy
then you can do whatever you like
sometimez even a smart gurl could go for a guy who isn't as smart as her.
you can't do what you are asking.
because most of guys are nothing but lying cheating dogs!!!!!!
do you chat in yahoo chat rooms?
be yourself, be confident, and be honest... if it's not meant to be then so be it
that's the best way to find out.
and i say this in the friendliest way that i can.
falling in love (really in love) is just magical... until reality hits you in the head :-)
there no better way than tell him frankly, but tendly, sweetly ...
_num_ is pretty young to be gaining a lot of weight.
i'm male, so it must be sex...
he not into toys or anything freaky.
when he starts seeing someone else
so what should i do for her!!
hi _num_, it's not just for lovers.
when your really in love u would do anything and everything _num_ that person!
well it depends on if you have feelings for her still.
dont pretend to act like something else!
nobody will give you a positive responce
just put it out there casually.
love is caring for someone, or something that you would not forget.
a song that's stuck in my head.
let him know how u truly feel and if he still can't find the time just blow him off.
but its really hard to avoid!
turn ons: hairy chest and chin.
if i didnt have kids i would die for the one i love.
he's such a sweet heart but i tell ya, i've gotta question his thinking skills sometimes..lol.
when u'll dive in her mind u'll know everything.
maybe, _num_ she does and _num_ she doesnt.
notiing wrong with this, does he join in also, i'd say if it's _num_ together thats cool, otherewise no
what kind of girlfriend is she?..ur trying to fix the trust, how?
i know quitting the school team was a good decision.
or you really love that person, me?
i hope all works whether it is finding your loved one or finding a new loved one.
if u dont trust him then how can he loves u or u love him.
there is still hope for these young girls
yeah your just confused and don't know who you want right now
sorry but my magic _num_ ball says no
however, whenever i send him a message he just ignores me!!!
love is not scary-if it scary =it not love you just haven't met the mrright yet so good luck
no i don't think that it's weird or geeky!!
open your mouth and say something!
=~ _num_ stronger than avg man.
if you love him so so much then please do
get out!-(and then)-get on with your lives!
dam thatz a real hard feelin.
and just re-met the first man of my heart....we talk openly and guilt is the biggest reason for gifts!
as they say....there's someone for everyone!!!
good luck!...i bet you get him!
i can't caz i m on the way to love.
what ever you decide.. quit giving in and having sex
he may be sensitive or just waiting on mrs. right!
my friend likes this guy and he said he would like to get to know her better.
and you don’t need special shoes !
what did he say 'oh hang on, i don't love you, i was mistaken.
i don't think so... behave yourself...
if they love you they will accept you no matter what!
u surely did the right thing!
walk up to her and ask, i like you alot, do you like me?
why can´t you just do it?
but i guess you could always try it, is it worth it to you??
if killing himself is what it's going to take for him to get over this then so be it.
keep quiet why hurt his feelings
if u cant do that then maybe u can email him.
iam humbly stating....i have all the above qualities...hahaha!!
tell him straight up it's better to hurt the person now than later
but it does not do anything with you.
he really haz a big crush on you!
she likes to dye her hair different colors
i think females do it too.
do married woman still givee head?
i just had a vision... you'll get married as soon as you decide to do so!
some guys are just like that.
god doesn't care about sexual procliviites, what a narrow way of thinking!
my friend old me this when i first saw that word
all of us can see it...why cant she?
if ya want to make love for more than _num_ min at a time.. don't have kids..
how about going up to her and asking her.
how can i handle this situation????
but u know how i overcame it???
try to just ask straight forward.
hey guys, does this sound familiar to you?
try it you might like not being horny!
whatevr u r saing is very right.
tell her not to see any bad guys!!!
it's d inside that makes us girls happy.
you didnt say if your wife had children .
actualy like few hours ago i kinda got offered to spend the night at a girls place i know..!
till him that you love him
i hate wearing flats and i won't do it just to make a guy feel better.
you have to want to let go and move on or you won't be able to.
act yourself; just keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together!
no but that would be funny because i am _num_ foot _num_
no matter how long it will take to let them go.
if he still doesnt, try to just be his friend.
does he care about things relates to your not?
guys are hunters like dogs that like the hunt but the chase is really what they are after...so run...run...run
he just wants you to do this so he will feel comfortable messing around as well!
i wear glasses and i have had boyfriends.
women liking women is very common and some grow to like it more others let if fade over time.
i don't, but homer simpson is hot!
i know i already said that.
weeelllllllll......men think with their penis' and it gets bored.
you can't stop thinking about the person youre inn love with
cause we only get blown _num_ times a week!
thanks for helping plan my wedding!
yeah, because chicks love it when you're obtuse.
point out where you want your man to put it.
see what gets you more heated up.
you didnot tell your age ,any way ask him to marry you first then think about kids
when she slacks off sleeping with you !
they r so beautiful and lovely
god is happy when _num_ people love each other- regardless of their sex.
if she's fine w/her apperance, u shld support her.
unless i found out i didn't really want it.
if i knew who she was i could help.
so my suggestion to you is dont get serious about getting serious
he did it one time he do it again????????????
somebody is there for ur good and for ur bad moments.
what should i expect from my bf if i go??
not even free lunch or fireworks.
if u dont u'll never have contact with him.
really good looking men tend to be vain.
at the maximum _num_ years older than you.
both is nice...just depending on what kinda mood/or day we are all having =)...
that is where i talk alot in yahoo chat for my state.
if you dont use it, you lose it
dude, i dunno how you feel about that, but umm... yuck.
save your heartbreak, find a nice guy.
i did quit and joined a rec team and i had so much more fun.
if he is married you should not even be friends.
if she asks me and i don't know the answer.
and yes ive got lots of chances!
well, i feel you on this one, cuz i'm goin thru the same thing right now.
just hang in there just enough so he doesn't think you're a bimbo.
if she wants to play mind games its time to move on to the next luv interest
are you hearing your self out?
i guess it depends.... have you ever committed a felony?
yeah, but i haven't met the right person which i would die for yet.
a girl should like you for who you are and nothing else!
so why shouldn't it be normal to do it on the phone!
you can but do u really mean it??!
_num_) b - i married a handsome mean guy and i divorced him.
obesty is the _num_ killer in young people now.
so, he says you don't truly love him because you only called him twice??
just stand firm and tell him it's over.
pity doesn,t get you into these panties.
my boyfriend farts and belches like a government mule!
my friend told me that she really loves me.
i don`t , life is serious, live it,you might enjoy
then go and hang out with them.
if you really love him ...do it !
maybe not for anything else but for the thrill of it!!!
our family hated the fact that it was a interraisal relasionsip my father and his grandmother lost it .
but before all that go to a flower shop an surprise her with flowers
don't try that , plz your life will be ended
just latch on to his di ck and you will instantly own him.
hope i was of some help.
no i don't care about my boyfriend's.
seducing a woman it's a great feeling, an achievment.
i personally dont really focus on a guys butt.
you dont...you just go on with life pretending you do
b/c then when one hurts u, o well u hav another to fall bac on.
don't be afraid to tell him what you want!!!
guys like a little (not alot) mystery in a girl.
without sex, there's one less evidence that two pple like each other.
if it's during sex she's not a virgin!
the problem is, i dont know if she likes me.
if he loves you, he'd care even it's just a petty things.
first of all, the guy didn't do it to you.
and he can not notice that.........!!!!!!!!
not really, do you still love him?
this is how my wife keeps my attention!!
tell her to get a life
what can i do with her for fun after school?
the world is going to end just becuase you ask stupid questions like this one.
p.s...not criticizing or labelling you at all!
don't text and ask, that's lame!!
my man loves me and i hope ur man loves u
it would look funny, but as long as u _num_ luv each other.
maybe he just doesn't feel like talking.
if its against your religion, then sry, i dont know wut to tell you.
i dont know who you meet.
don't make yourself sound so disgusting....and cheap... married men are off limits...
you just opened a can of worms!..lol.
some poeple just need a little push.
both of u should be understanding and be able to adjust.
you want a decent guy, i'm right here.
you will don't worry and i agree wit _num_ is something brining u down
this means she is interested in you.
_num_ out of _num_ times, what you like seeing him in, isn't what he is comfortable in.
try thinking about another girl man.
boys are more but they hate to show it because they think its girly.
i need somebody that i can really care for
hey, what are you saying, seems you know nothing about women.
don't buy a women clothes unless she picks it out, you do not know what looks good on her.
love her, trust her, she will love u all the more for it.
some say if they ask god for forgivness for being gay they will enter heaven...
admit it she doesnt wanna go out with u
if your girl loves you to bits, then your past shouldn't stand in your way.
yeah guys are stronger physically, i'll give you that.
so how do i tell them?
stop asking questions like 'how do i get girls to like me !!!!!!
well there may b some reason _num_ such a kind of behaviour .
list as many as you please;)
if along time you should no the answer to that .
been married _num_ time and have two sons!!!
who knows it's all up to you in the end.
but if u really want to know just ask her.
allways remember, there plenty more fish in the sea!
you should go out with a guy you like.
asking him if he still finds you disirable?
i learned it in school and i'm good at problem solving.
he seems like a real jerk!
i like the frst one.but i am _num_ so call _num_
it makes the phone all slimy and it smells funny.
since you mom kicked you out, she has no say anymore.
even if he never admits it, dont allow it if you dont want it.
scary b'cuz risk ur feeling and ur heart and put it in the hands of someone else.
yes, and it can last forever if you work at it and grow with it.
if you are married, it is pleasure, pleasant and you live for thst
if u want to cry while talking to her cry.
common, you want your cousin to love you.
if you get the real answer here my email teshtad@yahoo.com
wouldn't she leave if she didn't love you?
but beware, if you wait too long, when you're ready most of girls will think it's wierd.
enjoy life cause u live only once.
hasn't there ever been a girl who you liked alot but not liked enough to be with?
wwarnsley's answer is a good one.
i did, and we are still together _num_ and a half years later
i think he got didtent because he feels bad.
be careful guy before u fall's into problem
sometimes you have to show guys what you like!
i invested in a food business there... its pretty good also...
there is a girl in my school who i sort of have a crush on.
you really come off as quite creepy...oh ya, stop texting her!!
who is gwen stefani married to?
and walking will take some of this weight off.
we've been talkin _num_ _num_ mnths.
lol.. what the heck are you waiting for... go after him duh!
when a girl looks at you, she is testing you.
im a boy i know what you should do
if it's a chess cake, much better !!
probably not, but again, i don't think i would want him to.
get him drunk and take off your clothes!
to you what can a woman do say or look like in order to be sexy
some can't live without it and others can.
right so go out there andd explore
it is not a bad thing.
it has to be something in the water!!
doesnt really matter bout his height, its bout how much u guys r in love
- if you are a man: act like a real gentleman.
as far as the love thing i dont know.
it was about _num_ ago but they still really love each other.
sometimes it really sucks, but it'll be when its meant to be.
boys want to become men and men want women.
which of course really pissed my off.
well first just huge him then look into his eyes and say i love you then say his name.
your rights are to date and go on!
if you are _num_ and he's _num_, then thats not so bad.
no one knows this girls intentions if she really loves him she will wait.
its not even for you ..
yeah, me _num_ and jj all go to his school.
well, just try to observe his action.
men like younger women and i am not going for a woman my age.
perhaps his wife doesn't seduce him the way she used to.
make her realise that she is too important for u and that u are the man of her dreams
try to smile before you look away so you don't make the girl think you think shes ugly :)
im smart but i dont think im smart enough for him.
that jus means u like to see ur self
i hate to say it, but its going to get worse once you're married.
but if not then he is sooooo not worth it....
post an ad in washington post
y r u _num_ even married?
then they might come after you or it was just not ment to be.
you have become just another 'booty call'!!!
looking at a masturbated woman is enjoyable, after she finish it i will directly have sex with her
i don't want to be annoying!
at least i would.oh and its cost free!
?/ why men are stronger ant tougher and more honest and resposible, and hardworking?
i go out of my way for a married man.
i see her terribly upset - what can we do?
but i don't have alot of money for fancy clothes, flowers,lots of food, & all the other wedding stuff.
i speak idiot, gruntinees and jabberwocky..maybe i can help pm me
whats so hard to understand?...the guy just wanted to get into your pants
hey doesnt everyone like theirself or @ least what they look like??
not accusingly, but just a nice conversation?
i think its a good thing.... to try the milk before you buy the cow .....
he tried to love someone romantically (me) but he just can't!
want to come see my hard drive?
why would he go to jail?
let your family know that person makes you happy.
you are still a kid wait
you should make the first move
if i had met the woman of my dreams she would be everything i need.
it is ok to like him even though others do not.
why do men lie so much?
tell them you dont want to have sex
it is better to 'lets quit'
you shouldn't second guess what you guys do if both of you are cool with it.
to th extent of giving my soul away...but if its oneside love i wont do anythng!!!
if only i knew the answer...
play with his lil buddy while hes playing
admittly we are simple creature while some men and women are just creeps.
there is no way to know
yes you can but it might not be love ,probably a strong emotion
i had one date with this guy who seemed so nice on the phone.
a _num_ year old guy tht never had intercourse with any girl!
tell her you been there and he gave you crabs
do it for your country man!
have them take a lie detector test - a good one.
pls help me out in this it is a problem to me
they are a big part of your life too...
when he screams where's my razor?
go upto him n speak out yr doubts
sure as long as you like him.
i still know a girl who's looking for mr.
either way it's going to be painful.
don't be dumb and stupid, be average in intelligence.
rent everything and have one of your family members take pictures and recordings.
because trust me: later in life you will regret it!
but i think _num_ _num_ is a pretty good age.
or im just scared or shy!
think of the &$%# he would get if he was dating a girl in jr. high.
it might be hard, but try to act like you don't want it.
love isn't bad...you should try it...
don't just hand it to her.
no, so long as you're both adults.
ask for her phone number... if she does not give it - then she does not like you.
tell him that you love him&#_num_;her in any way.
if he doesn't answer directly, or does the smoke and mirrors thing.... u know what u need to do.
well all depends on how long you been with her .
if she blows you off, forget it.
well, if he only kind of likes her then he shouldn't get too mad.
you guys need a marriage counsellor or a bigger bed.
hang-outs clubs, groups....good luck and have fun.
spend lots of time with your girlfriends - hang out -have fun - let yourself be around other guys.
did you catch him or did he volunteer the info.
go out with your mates and have a great time!
but oops.. now i really love my wife very much.
... oh yeah, a great sense of humor, good-natured and self-confidence.
holy grail my friend, wish i knew.
is having sex with your boyfriend something normal?
but i've learned that if a guy really likes you, he'll show it.
ok been there done that sweetie.
i have too much to live for.
where do i go for help?
i think you should tell him that you have to respect your best friend and he should respect you.
take him to s good bar were you can play darts and pool
happy u r. mature and attractive enough.
no contact whatsoever just a simple crush or do i have to get over it.
either that or just flirt a little bit.
of course cause i wouldn't be able to live with her death
dont hurt her... good luck just remember there are lots of men out there.
depends on choice, but i like dog style too much..ok
what happens if the relationship does'nt work out?
you two should be boinking like rabbits.
nah..you girls are just too paranoid in everything
maybe d love wasnt really that much when u got married.. u just thought it was!
then you can do these things together!
give me your input because i hate valentine's day.
just be who you are and enjoy whatever it is you like.
no only if you want your friend to watch too
we have phone sex everyday, never get tired of it.
noooooooooooooooooooooooo but it can make it alot worse!!
treat him just like you would a good friend you have not seen in a long time.
if you are really her friend you won't even consider it!!
i almost at the point where i no longer even care to give it a shot.
nope but if your in love sex is a totaly differant experiance.
losers dont usualy like other losers.
yea i used to do it all the time
that's a very good question.... not one thing i could thing of...
if you guys dont have sex, then i dont see a problem.
would you like it if your future husband cheated on you?
hey guy, i've seen you on a cd, havent i, and i like famous singers!
if he loves her why not?
sweety, why can't you just ask her out?
get ideas off of the knot website.
think about it in my opion dump this fellow?
other than that, there should be no reason why you shouldn't go out with him.
kick his ass and get rid of him.
do you really want to marry a guy in a trial for _num_ attempted murders???
then you will no her if or when your feelings change.
just brief your story and hope i can help u in many ways.
if all he wanted was to make-out with u, he didnt really love u!
i know my ex did me the same way.
for the long tertm: yes for the short: no
yeah it depends on how long you've been chatting.
no, he should not get married to her at this time.
my girlfriend is crazy about this butt thing.
dont be so posesive, let him free, guys likes freedom
heck no, i'm a guy, and i wouldn't care if she masturbated infront of me, i would enjoy it.
maybe you are into the bad boys???
men dont like women to tell them what they need to do.
whana come sit in my cock pit!!
i personally think it's kinda weird.
she cant stop you from seeing your little man.
even on silent he can see the missed calls.
run like hell and never look back.
if she's shy than probably she reaallyyy likes you.
and with protection u can start anytime.
just keep going till you hit the next level i.e level _num_
one was wolf the other a very large lab
some men do and some men don't....
actually this sounds weird but try watching both kinds of porn one gay, one straight.
if the guy treats you great, who cares what his butt is like.
i praised my god for got her as my wife.
u can tell him anytime.he'll probably do that if he isn't gay
i didn't believe till i saw her eyes.
maybe shes playinhg hard to get or she really likes u n dousnt admit it.
hey, honey...do you wanna talk about what's going on?
and why do the girls there have facial hair?
i guess things can get lost but memories... well is little harder to get rid of them ;)
and definitely consider asking ur older sis again.
surprise her with it and give her little gifts during the dinner!
yeah right he knows he dont know me!
in my sweetie's eyes, i am.
if you both can wait, then it's worth it.
i used to be like that.
you'll never get any peace if you keep him around
forget all about him, don't go out of your way to make him think your over him
but i hope not, i have enough trouble with gays making googley eyes at me on earth.
it means she probably wouldn't have left you if you would have chilled out back then.
mabie you married the wrong guy ?
well, yes, but i hope i never have to.
woman want it more and the men are saying no.
you don't want to spend the rest of your life wondering what if.
you can go somewhere else with your bf when you both have time.
sex is one of the most important things a man can do in life and it feels greatttt
because if u knew that, u might try to do or be that.
what the hell should i do?
if ya are waiting for prince charming to come and find you.. _num_ words.. old maid!
keep your boyfriend, but find a lover!
lovin up with some skeezer tramp.
how can i go and talk to her??
get rid of anything having to do with him
what was this all about, i'm curious now?
you know what you want, don't you?
it's simple.... just don't do it.
nope are u a guy or girl?
most people don’t even get there.
r u and ur spouse still together?
what can we do...put a ad in the local paper...
just look around u. i beleive this is hell and heaven.
tell him to leave her alone.he should be looking for another one.
if we want money you just want sex not love.
she's not even in college yet, and u want _num_ have a serious relationship?
how cool and we should thank him each day for wonderful feelings of sex!
okay, if you want it to be special, don't buy her etible panties!
last recourse, cling and pray to jehovah god and to his son jesus christ!
do they really love you or do they just say it.
i think not, unless your trying to commit suicide?
great kisser but great sex is nice too:)
my friend had no idea how she ruined me.
how else could you be but straight forward?
listen, if he loved you to begin with he wouldn't of wanted you to have an abortion!
if you truly feel in love, you should get on a plane and elope with them.
right then is when you need to relax for a while.
i ve never been with a guy who doesnt have a great body.
what a tangled web you've woven...
why dont you ask him out?
i know i personally would want my daughter to be a lesbian because i know what guys are like.
then it wont be breaking the law because youll be holding her for ransom instead of dating her
ask a question ya might get an anwser intead of just points
some people are very ignorant thats all just be there for them
you ask her and she should honestly tell you.
but according to me its unfair!
if someone used sex toys and it wasn't good then it didn't help them.
try saying what if we got married one day?
i guess you are queer, just be your self, you can't please an human being.
what is your problem your aready maried!
you can't train 'em to put the toilet seat down and you sure can't change their minds!
wow...well ive been in the situation.
i know this is a lot to remember, but trust me!
please help: what do i do??
a woman married a dolphin, so why not
turn offs: bad breath, body odor and farting and belching a lot.
if you have back pain, get a breast reduction.
not all married men cheat, i didn't when i was married, my wife was my life.
like peach fuzz is ok, but not hairy like a mens chest can get.
your suppossed to sign that thing????
she's playing with you is what my neighbor says is going on.
you have a long history with him and you know the real him.
or you can say hey wanna sexy want to go for a soda, just kidding.
i guess i don't really get too concerned about it.
he's an inspiration yet i don't want to get involved but i am dying to be close enough.help!
p.s.- the muslim question is funny.
im sure thats what a guy would want.
i have same idea with westling
its not your fault they are very weak minded .
why did you like doing it?
if they do, then ask him to hang out.
yeah, the woman i love is worth worth death, if she died i wouldn't want to be alive anyway.
hun if ya want to be girlfriend materal be yourself.
r u an alien dont knoe the importance of sex?
ask him out, guys dig that
i want to so bad but i don't just want to do it.
if so, how often, and why or why not?
get a younger guy for god's sake.
you see her looks and thats it!
hang in there and keep your head up....you are a great person!
and when your hot like you are its worth it
yes of course with a poem written on the cake
i mean, because what's a relationship if you can't talk to each other about stuff like that?
and it cant be all hairy.
you will know....you will feel it!!!
i wouldn't doubt him, just maybe.
like ours go to their breasts.
what is wrong with you ?
wow, sounds great except for the _num_ months thing, give it some time dude!
:) seriously though, the best way is just to tell them.
just ask if you can't tell.
tell your parents u love them and move on.
god doesn't care, love is love.
boys just want sincere and caring females who can accomodate them in life and nothing else
because they feel like they are not needed by there husbands
always listen to your gut feeling.
open it and ask her just like ya did here.
but i am unsure of that.
think, what's her favorite resturaunt...cofee shop...vineard...etc.
none of the above,ask me about big boys or small boys,and i will tell you.lol
(i don't want to be mean) but it sounds like he may have some cheating issues.
yeah i f****n hate this day too!!
