no seriously, think about howmany cocky girls are out there.
without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty.
then he said do you want some of my chapstick?
hold her hands, look to her eyes and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
you never let a man mistreat you
nope, he's too darned big and i'm too darned weak!
and if he says yes than you can tell him.
what was the mistake that you did
king had a song about this - only your mother loves you (and see might be jiving too).
we fall in love they treat us bad why are we there
and if you have, what was it like?
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off.
only if you want it to be.
it's like breaking a drug habit.
oh man i should do that when im dating next time!
but you do what you want.
it sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are.
don't let her rule your life, she will just have to learn to deal with it.
if he doesn't then there are too many fish in the sea.
no single man can give you what you really want.
that said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him.
start with a basic everyday question and go from there :)
ask if they wanna go somewhere with you.
trust him, don't bring it up again.
:) i haven't tried it yet, but i am still trying to get up the nerve....
just find one that loves you too.
come to my town ill be your girl....
stay _num_ miles away from this guy.
it's your choice not to hate one, i dislike them to say the least.
i would say around _num_ or _num_
i don't know....how would you like something crammed up your butt!!
he's telling that to some gurls too... he's a womanizer..
probably because i knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until i met my wife.
and whatever you do, don't try to have both of them at once.
sex is not the only thing important in life damn it!!!!!
i have yahoo email and that works for me.
fun includes eating meals (not breakfast if yo know what i mean).
but he was a lil busy after that.
and that will be just s*x!
please don't go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
sounds like u r going through a lot right now.
but ask a girl about the sympthoms because i'm a boy.
i always felt the same way, but i met my true love and my views changed!
guys are stupid!who knows why they do what they do.
but -- there's no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
i dont wanna just randomly go up nd be like go out wiht me?
you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
u need to reput it in add it back just like first time
no good or bad is your personal belief on something.
they bother u all day long.
go to hawaii...ha ha ha or ....pay someone...lol
his/her intelligence,the way they carry themselves,good looks and activeness
i can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash........lol
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry?
if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off.
well if it was before you then he wasnt cheating at all... obviously.
!he must be a control freak
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
and get married only after you've been with a guy for more than _num_ years.
to all my fellow girls at cone, a big hi and hug!
just be yourself when you are with her.
what the hell r ya talking abt?
...a guy asks me, 'do you mind if we cuddle?
but some guys would do that... why?
there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place.
either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
get a grip, how can you love someone that you don't even communicate with.
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
it doesn't mean that you are slutty.
the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love!
you have to search yourself for this one...
give them _num_ months they will get over you.
after a while you dont even see the color.
he is probably wondering if your interested in him at all....flirt back!!
if she is not into you anymore...
you are definitely not a hoe, don't worry.
;) there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
if you're asking, then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options.
have you ever had a pap smear.
yes all i can say.. but yes, i have long black hair and im proud!!
i had a friend in the same situation.
maybe your young, i don't know.
hi, my name is xxxxxx been working for me for years.
i don't understand someone please give me the answer
if you truely love him you will tell him
just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it.
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it, do if you want to.
stay alive and get your old life back.
dude, what your sayin is she doesn't want to be more than bf and gf?
don't use pick up lines , that's a turn off .
it hurts....alot...maybe some girls might say that's it?
tell him what you really want...that's what they tell me but never got to do...speak up...
(it would be easier to do if i were mad, though!!
if they have moved on then you should too.
no , you are punish , and no tv for a month
tell him, and it wouldn't seem psycho cuz u have kno each other for a long time
but thats her way... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open...
it is very complcated tell it again please but in simple
give them a chance to discover you.
unless it's with the wrong man.
my bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up.
depends on if they are brunette or not
it's got to get played out after a while.
everybody likes to be told that they're hot, even if they don't admit it!
downtown houston just about any weekend... lots of clubs...
good luck but do your homework!
i'll go with anything natural than fake i even hate the word fake
if you like the guy then go for it.
only now she and i are both divorced.
who said women dont feel anything?
no matter what he says, action speaks louder then words
i was thinking about a medium pink color, but with what??
see if he calls, e-mails or even cares.
and never ignore her always listen to her...and when you do don't change the subjetct women hate that.
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out.
she will tell you if it's not ok.
i dont think i mind either way.
don't eat where you take a s***.
also try getting some blonde highlights
dont worry about him n just sonsentrate in school so you can lern n then woory bout yer b/f
b) looks definitely matter, anyone saying they don't is probably lying.
ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part.
you give at least _num_ minutes for kissing and huging and may be some licking also .
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
try to be your self and don't show off
good luck and i hope everything goes well!
if they dont then you'll have to get on with your life.
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan.
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life.
lol most important... just be yourself.
i know _num_ guys that i can probably get away with doing something like that.
they probobly know you cant really hide that but you should tell your parents
this is doc izzy and i love and adore bigger women!
if he if flurting with her ok jump him .
stick with the _num_ & _num_ year old boys .. they are easier to control anyway.. lol good luck
tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb!!!
i guess it's kind of nice, it's like your dad's blessing all the way.
wait for him to ask u out unless ur real desprete
i really like this guy, and i don't know if it's just a crush, or if i love him......
if he insists, it means he only after sex.
i find if i try real hard i can see things i know aren't there normally there.
i would like to have some fun with u that's why i answered this stupid question
do u fell that way ?
give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike!!
maybe he's going to call you!
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her.
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad
so i guess i pick domestic goddess.
do u love her in depth?
also men get bored and tire way before woman do.
a big savings area is flowers.
ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
if you aren't happy fix it or get out.
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend doesnt mean he is.
then she might say that looks ugly i think (a color) looks better.
you can do a civilian arrest _num_
u can have a big u-no-what, n suck in bed.
so so sexy yes it look very nice on most any girl
guys have a problem with secrets.
yes but it dipends of the guy
people asked me - whats the hurry?
they both dont respect your feeling.
ok i see him ever week in psr but i just cant talk to him!!!
i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time.
i think it's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs.
did turn gay or is it a curiosity thing?
i myself think that they do.
it is a mistake that can't be undone!
in a park when i was _num_ i lost my virgenate
they never met but she says they're in love.
and ask if he wants to dance with you.
and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
did you fell goog because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful
like i said; he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breathe and ask him.
keep away ur fear and tell him.
and im sure as heck not driving _num_ hrs just to hang out unless i really really like her.
does she have other friends to gab with on the fone?
play sports with your guy friends.
when you first fall in love, your gitty, goofy, and silly happy just thinking about that person.
i can't see my life without my husband.
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away.
wait til you get older and if you both still feel the same way then go for it!
tell her, girls like to her the truth good luck
do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time.
you are a man <--- term used lightly!!
i prefer a & b cups, myself.
any women beside the ugly guys will look hot...
no _num_ years younger, who wants an older women?
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
just let her know what you feel.
show her your naked baby pictures.
why do gays want to get married?
on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome!
and women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
but you need to do this a few times.
whle making love is like living a fantasy.
as for now i think he is mad, hurt, upset and got over you.
if anyone know let me know
red= love, black = death ect...
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one!
if you don't know ask someone who would.
then comes the fun part...he making it up to you :-)
wow, go with the one that picks on you because _num_ times out out _num_ he likes you
ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade.
you catch her looking at you?
i never knew life could be so good!!!!
ok like i really really really like this guy and i dont know if he likes me back.
do whats best for you and he
hey it's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol!
so in my opinon ur not a hoe!
but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry.
she calls him all the time.
you are already doing it so why yet bother?
there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also.
should i dump him because of his mother
make a kind move , if no responce u know what to do !
i've heard of friends getting married about _num_ months after meeting somebody.
be yourself say whats up and you might get a response
show her what you're good at.
you will look like an idiot.
finally a culture that has it right.
if you don't you'll always wonder.
let me know what you think, thanks
i wouldn't worry too much about it.
what's the worst that could happen.
i'm confused i hate the girl to be like that ... what shall i do ?
preferrably someone who doesn't hate you.
stop trying to slap it in everyones face!!!
that's not exactly true.... it's just that most girls are discreet about it...
some guys just don't like to dance.
this generation is just too stupid.
so you have one baby out of wedlock.
it depends on if you could trust him before!
ugly (or fat) guys just take what they can get.
people are husbands and wives for reasons!!!
if all you do is argue it's not worth it..
have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate.
u are asking do u like me
depending on what you kissed ;)
)women are curious about sex with other women, even me!
_num_ to _num_ doesn't have to be younger than you.
simple...honesty and love and try to true with them
then u can make an easier decision.
pickup lines are tacky..just be yourself and complament her alot..women like that
but he chaeted, so i guess i can lift or carry my husband.
just try and make the best of what's to come.
depending on what yo uare looking for, freindship only, like.
i think he would make a great valentine.
(this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there).
is it usually about a year before both people begin _num_ feel in that comfortable,boring, stage??
it all depends on when ur ready.
hell ya i would love to meet the ladys!!
dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is.
remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits.
if u can imagine him as the father of ur children !
if he turns you down, hes not worth it in the first place!!!!
well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it.
you married your hubby hopefully because you love him .
well depend on women wot she want
i know i have someone to come home to.
get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
i have no idea where to begin!!!
that depends...are you a hottie w/a body?
r u talking about ur avatar?
hang out all day together and to top it off touch his feet.
if a guy cares he calls.
if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate.
however, i always believed in the fact there's a huge different between having sex and making love.
first off, i have _num_ kids....so a homemaker is more work than my job even.
don't just stay with him for the baby.
are you a country girl or a city girl.
getting married and getting child can wait but studies can't.
i have never been to it
the same guy you wanna be in a relationship with?
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me.
i love curly hair i like to run my fingers thru it
i mean the both of you together.
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
i want my wife to grow too.
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
the doctor can't even believe it.
if you play w/both at the same time, she will probably f-*# the sh%$ out of you!
practice kissing me were do you live?
may be u think not but yes!!!
may be becaues your name is freakgirl but if you show your face maybe not no hard feelings
no men don't but little boys do
how about...would you like to go out with me sometime?
hell, it happened to me twice.
you shouldn't go out with a guy because you 'need' to.
if you really wanted to be with him, you wouldn't be asking.
and i hope to god it doesn't ever pass!
honestly, most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels.
plus they are more passionate in love makin.
never stop trying to impress her .
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead.
yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
its all about her, and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date.
ok it depends on how much your starting to have feelings for this boy!
thanks for the pep in advance!
why do they want to be married???
we like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing.
i married my guy anyways and do you know why (besides love).
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum.
i like sos and need to know if im in love
do you like fake nails or manicured ones?
only two points to make friends _num_
but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
i don't know what u mean.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
well, you, and that sexy perfume you wear!!
practice to unrap starburst wrappers with your tounge, the girls love it!
it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously don't care.
i can't explain it...and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable or submissive.
as everyone said... dont get married so early.
if you plan on cheating on your wife...you're a freaking pig and need to be shot!
then be your best self, if he's impressed or likes you he'll talk back
you dont want anyone else but that person ever
don't persue it, he is getting married.
have you told her that it's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday?
so, when i moved in my neighbor asked me out.
most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... _num_ points...
if not, then don't sweat it!
do you like to argue and fight???
if he really didn't like her and did like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
the main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
one man willing to move _num_ _num_,_num_ miles just to be with me.
just want to know have you been to the doc yet !
maybe she's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
get a life and don't waste mine.
its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat.
i went and there he was.
if he is, then go for it!
men like this, typically become wife beaters if you don't obey them!
you like him or you don't like him?
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready.
many people will tell you no!
if u think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel;;u should!!
well i believe everybody should keep their own name.
guys come & go, but friends are forever!
imgaine if it was just considered love??
if your relationship survive the four seasons... i guess you should be ready....
ok now some guy's like girls like that and some don't
if you want kids, then homemaker.
should i or shouldn't i. younger guy vs older woman
of course he wants to go on.
stay true to your husband...after all, he's the one you said i do to...
so it would have to be love.
ur self image is also very important.
im a gilr, i say those things....
girls are just as perverted--trust me.
:) although, flowers are really nice even if they don't last.
there are movies that i haven't seen yet.
it is realy sweet and just what u r looking for!
my be she don't love you but try to use your brean not your haerd
no offense, but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended!
i wouldn't bother calling him back.
none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife :d
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
don't listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
what shuld i do to get her ?
give a rose and express ur love
its unusal yes, but nothing bad.
you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s!
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are !
yes for sure, especially when she throw up!!
because....you know.......try to search you love.....but becareful.....!!!!!!
i can't help any more unless i have more infor.
there isn't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
do you have to rush your choice?
having fun with guy friends is ok. _num_
just think about what you like and do it back for them....kinda like a tounge massage.
my boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss!
it's more of a trust issue i'd say.
i just need someone to help me figer this out
then if he still doesn't like you, then move on.
he probably doesnt want to either.
when possible, try to make it yourself.
yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it.
all seniors think freshman girls are easy, its sad but true
so how do i just kiss him
go to deleted items and it should be there
i hope you find a nice girl.
i don't think it's good idea, u are not there for this purpose!
the list could go on and on.
brokeback mountain ,ok it's a guy but at least you'll be happy!
i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
i prob will tell her soon cuz shes my best friend ha well any help would be nice.
yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
good luck and hang in there.
umm small party for the family
and if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - dont.
i would be, but i'm just married !
i think it all depends on age, upbringing, .
you both should pick either his or yours once you have kids.
your kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a dad.
men without hair look like little boys to me, and it's not sexy at all.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
or ask about the score of last game?
get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now.
the best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
sure let me know more 'bout you
anything bigger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d
lie lie lie and then lie some more
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure!
wife says, we don't wear that shit.
we dont no what you look like !
bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
lol i think this is better than the one on top of me...
don't go anywhere you went with him or her.
talk _num_ your best friend and see if its cool
sounds strange but it worked in about _num_-_num_ days for me!
when he teases you about the stupid little things.
no, because i'm not married yet
lots of men like thick girls, most of them are black.
i love to express my feelings to the ladies with poems, has anybody written one for a special someone.
i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship.
no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him.
or does his friends point at you when your with him.
i love them b/c im a guy and i dont have to ask anyone to the dance
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you shouldn't get married.
it really depends if someone is vain or not.
move on and find someone who doesn't hate you.
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off.
maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
whatever you decide, make it completly yours!
tell him you don't want a real relationship.
if you are happy she should be happy, unless he really is being bad to you.
there is nothing but trouble there!
not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years.
and hes seen me every day for about _num_ or _num_ years!
imagine that i am that guy and be my girl freind!
it never hurts to be flirty!
but stick with wats inside of u.
best of luck to you both :)
i've been with this girl for _num_ months and we haven't kissed is this bad?
depends on the woman, it's better shaved=-)
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there.
even the day after would be okay.
then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie.
yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman.
ask in english terms...cannot understand you
sorry, i never have felt that way!
remember, no bird ever flew on one wing!!
i actually ponder this one now and again.
u seem desperate and you'll never find a if you're desperate.
imet a girl and i want to know how to know if shes into me or not
but don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
shut the hell up and be gay if you want to!!!
many women _num_ are dating men _num_ so the _num_ yo men feel insecure and have to fish downstream
if he comes to his senses then great if not screw him!!
i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father.
(saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self...and don't ever get weak!!)
do it before it is to late
this gal does not want a bad boy at all.
i`d like to see what a black female has to say about this.
help me win this debate with her !
most often (not always) that will be guys around your age, give ot take.
when will people in this effed up world finally realize this?!?!?!?!?!?!
and i dont know what i should do.
you go to a bar and get drunk!
i did this with my current boyfriend.
no, not if you have to ask...
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one.
(and now even in devorce im stuck with it !
you'll be fine just have fun!
your girlfriend will just think you're a jerk.
her parents?u can't fix it... her friends?maybe u can talk to them nicely...but, pls specify , why?
now me, i wouldn't marry any women who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so.
my ex of _num_ years cheated.
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens.
well, the one i liked goes like this.
not all guys get bored and move on.
they're a lot of fun - there's plenty to do.
but it is okay to kiss on the first date.
i have a close girl friend.
they are always in the 'in love' stage.
when he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
my friend says i am to nice and i should tell them no.
but (there's always a but isn't there?
not all guys, but some guys do
that way you can still go by your last name!
go up to her and say 'hi, are you single?'
that got me really hot, but i ran off.
however that does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
not everyone on here is in school.
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue, and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue.
if you keep talking to him for another week,he might think he is married to you.
me, i'll pick up the tab if, i can get your vote for best answer.
you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable.
flirt and see how he reponds
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone...
say will u go out with me!!!!!!!!
(i mess up alot at times ) but she don't forget.
is how should i approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her?
as a guy - let me say this.
you're _num_ don't even worry about it...
always trail ride with a friend.
if you guys truely love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc.
its all in the eye contact
yup, i can lift him, he's only _num_
he just has to start over and earn your trust again.
listen it aint that easy.i got with my ex-boyfriend in _num_ grade,then again in _num_,and again in _num_
sak her out what's up with that?
well i hope you read this really well.
play a truth or dare game together
wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there!
stupid u need a theory class _num_ that!!!!!!!
if you do eat something like that then just quit.
now i keep thinking of getting it on with a girl.
confront him and ask him that way you will know
yes jaime is going to ask rubi out.... but it is not yoru business...
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
may be its interesting for them
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... _num_ points...
or do guys really do prefer bigger women?
he loves you, too, girl...time will tell.
if a guy really respects u then he'll understand.
this is sin, our selves have started this
his answer is good enough for me...
move on, but you can still luv him!!
intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy!
i like older girls so i think this is sick and wrong that they cant go out with her
when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready.
my last bf i met driving round a roundabout in another car!!
but he is getting married this month.
should i just forget it and move on?
replaying everything you ever did to me?
okay well first thing it sounds as if you guys are already married!.
first of all, why did u guys break up?
maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back.
tell more ppl (my bor did)
so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing.
say hey(whateverhisnameis) when ya taking me to dinner???
no, not if you have to ask.
go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends.
i never wanted to have sex again.
let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him!
some people choose not to because of thier religion, others don't.
you should be proud of yourself.
so, no i feel its a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
you gotta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him!
i don't mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful.
just tell them, what are they gonna do, slap you??
sound like you like to sell yourself to much.
see if he is willing to go out the way for you.
but it doesn't mean you cannot love another.
how would anyone know if they don't know anything about you?
who gives a crap what anyone else thinks.
if you could have _num_ qualities in your woman, what would they be.
we like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
i feel goofy, dorky, and happy.
just keep it cool, a little hard to get might help!
look at the way she walks.
if you two are at a dance, he shouldn't really care.
gals luv guys with positive self image.
ask her out after class again.
you should go see a shrink!
i think im still totally in love w/ him...
but thats ok. im a giver.wink, wink.
want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
you just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better.
but i am not telling you to be celibate till then ;-)
if he doesn't want to dance, then give it up.
hey, i'm a guy, but i'll tell you a little.
my girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class, butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
we can't answer if she really means it.
hey i really want to know so please help me out!!
i have long black hair and i love it,hubby loves it too.
everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days.
wanting to be something they're not?
no you wont huni......i was married to a complete arsehole!!!!
stay away from this guy friend.
i'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
and its been the best thing for at least me.
i met this guy once, very romantic, i met him in this huge rainstorm.
i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard.
could it ever be the same...
it could be ( choose one & why? )
so wait for another _num_ years.
either way, best of luck but i'm just glad that i have brown hair!!
if your talkin hubby or the like i'd say tools toys for his vehicle, sports related things.
not what you can become just because she says too.
the problem is that he cheated on me recently and it was the worst that he could of done.
well, if u can imagine ur self with him in bed @ night!!
it hurt like hell and i bled.
it could probably mean a lot of things.
_num_ years gap is just nice.
stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact
you want all your friends forever?)
and i hate him for it.
but, i know exactly what i want in a relationship.
in the middle of the river while there was ppl watching it was actually pretty fuuny!!
if yor hott too show him your boobies
so its natural with that guy.
i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga.
go out & do everything you couldn't when you were with him/her!
yes it is very possible to enjoy giving pleasure rather then recieving it
its been half a year- is it normal _num_ still like him??
if you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again.
guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually.
it is absolutely just a challenge!!!!!!!!!!!
everywhere.... just ask any girl passing by.... but only in thailand.... not in us .... lol
is very important to last at least _num_-_num_ minutes!!!
problem is i really like him.
cause it's buy one take one.
wow i didn't think pakistan is that conservative.
we can restle around and be the best of friends.
i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
you didn't give us very good information/ do you all live in one house.
..... you tell her why you like her!
its one way of saying i don't like you!
hey, its like, everyone's gotta seperate some day or the other.
i even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams.
i'll probably go and see one.
why wait,,,,, go ahead do it
girl there are more guys out there that love thick girls than u think?
it really was a casual aside when i said it -- i didn't think he would remember.
girls don't like guys who is all about themselves.
yes there are you just have to look.
depending on the age, cds or dvds.
both of u work hard to get it right!!
if she's interested she'll call later.
i really care about you and i can't stop thinking about you.
overtime should i give him another chance?
if you feel your love is fading, don't just sit there and do nothing!
don't know, but daniel k has never read manga.
try using some of these, but only if they actually apply!!!
and i hear ya fountain...same thing happened to me.
or that she just wants to see other people?
pick the one you like the most.
just be prepared to let her go.
i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front and maybe i told this guy to much.
i guess its normal, but id just move on
just get rid of him you will be better off
sometimes but you have to observe the one you call your man.
or if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
and so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
my girlfriend's the nuttiest, but i love her anyway.
u'll find a man who really deserves u one day).
be strong, and hang in there.
or, what about blue and green?
some guys do...and some guys don't.
generally kind and my fifth: i'll just be dissapointed if she's stupid.
it's not that bad... at least it is not bella
i hoping for at least a _num_ but realistically i think its more like _num_ or _num_
think about what good it brought about.
i do not know what she wants.
my bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but i won't.
we was hangin out a lil.
you still released at least a thousand!
all my friends want to do is makeout!
happy birth day to you .
because women think with their brains.
complement her...ask her name...dont act weird...act like u r the smoothest guy ever.
after how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she isn't really interested?
girls don't think it's cool, they think it's guys who smoke are pathetic cos they are killing themselves
so i'm only myself around guys i dont like, and you know the outcome.
the timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy...you'll see!
take them both out at the same time
i am the maid of honor for my only sister and i want it to be perfect!
my boyfriend snores and i have the most terrible time sleeping!
why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather.
if you want your girlfriend forever..........then just don't let her know that you want her forever, simple.
if she is calling just to bablle then tell her to not call you so often!
i have to stop right away because i'm ready to relieve myself.
for me anything after _num_ days and i might start to forget about you.
or just you wanna say that!?
i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt
people don't like to be played yo-yo with.
who knows but i would absouletly love that _num_ be done _num_ me.
and impress her with affection and love.
man has penis and woman has clitoris.
by now, you might love your wife for everything you guys have endured.
i don't need a trophy girl i want a companion.
i hate it my self, i love the straight ones
if shae like him then there is a reson .
there no one you can trust more than a good friend !
thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker.
if your the average guy breast size shouldn't matter.
i am man and i too feel so.... because i too am !!!
try to contact their q&a team..they'll help you through..have a nice day!
i like intelligent,fun and hot girls.
hell yeah for the first answer.that girl answered for me.
if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex!
uh- wher've u been meeting these filipinas?
maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing.
no i haven't..i prefer normal-looking guys
i had someone get nasty with me because i was still dating?
i'm ready to move on, but i love him way too much!
yea ask for permission by all means and watch how fast she slap the s--- out you
guys think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
depends, some days i want to have sex, somedays i don't.
this is just what i have nurt many times.
it just sounds like u wear the pants.
hang in there for one that apprecaites you.
don't come here, it smells like a trap to me.
smaller of course, and it is all about looks!!
sweetheart let him go ,if he is ment to be with u he will come back to you
the guy i like is mad at me.
so - u like asian food?
my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying he was a hot teen that she met online
if you have to ask, then you are not in love.
dont even listen to what people not just guys say, watch how they act.
its ur personalitie, keep to it, whether a guy goes out with u shouldnt determin how u act.
i still love him what to do
just talk your spouse about this
if you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances...
you are killing the romance by popping up that stupid question, ever thought of having fun together instead?
also actual kissing and asking if your a good kisser...
haha julesac is funny, but mean.
see my boyfriend (go to my _num_)?
the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me.
i know because i am just like your wife.
if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
rip off your shirt and do a tarzan yell.
unless you dont love your husband anymore and you have room for another man????
compliments, honesty and make it about her.
i'm into a _num_ grade boy too!
beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys..........
maybe you and i can get together sometime & we'll find love with one another.
if she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
my friend has a bf who she talks _num_ online and on the phone.
but cuddling up with a large women is one of the best feelings i know of.
i think the bomb is much easier!!
one his side of his family i met his father.
anything that is not nailed down!
be her friend first then see where it goes
i was cheated on for _num_ of the years.
jump him because she likes him??
dont tell them but let them find out once your in bed with her.
here in america it is not so important...
be confident,always believe in yourself.do not be arrogant though.always make good eye contact.listen to what she has to say.
let it take it's course from there.
i dated one and i know.
i wish i had listened to my friends
if he doesn't start acting right, then leave him.
just do what makes you happy!
we tried to move on but it didn't work.
if you dont ask sombody else might.
my twin wont talk or listen to me
most girls are polite she'll answer it
you married him and it was for a reason.
just face him, say hey i like you wanna see a movie?
some woman cannot seem to find guys their own age attractive.
but that didnt bother me, because like i said wa&#_num_;e were just friends .
in that case tkake some defense classes.
at least thats what it seems like to me.
how drunk is this girl getting?
u should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them.
do you know he loves you?
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat
those was good times i tells ya.
if your a hoe then he's one to...i personally don't think your one tho
because the white women are taking up all the men!!
ofcourse, if she calls like _num_ times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
tell the bastard to get out.
good god how old are you ?
they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
if you really love him, you would let him go...
someone i can be myself with.
the rest is easy from there!!
say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
i just got out of a _num_ yr relationship with my baby's father.
good luck in your search for the one!
after i while i t passes and i still love him
look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
some women like big hairy guys, some guys like fat women, some gals like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
my wife forgives me for alot of things .
what if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits.
i like him and he says stuff like, if i weren't dating _ i would go out with you?
they are often worse than men!!!
is she just trying to use you?
dont do things tht can get you hurt.
you would be genuinly suprised in the type of people that go to them.
wait till you get _num_ you would not loose your charm by then.
so if you're set on that, that's the way to go!!
so thats why i ask why dont guyz ever know what they want with any kinda relationship!?!?!
if you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles.
but really if you're used to it and you kinda like it, go with it.
remember, till death do you part!!
wit her takin ur number, there's nothing wrong wit that.
if yes, why do i heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last?
and don't start with her looks, mister!
if you two are serious then asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
the pictures i've seen...i would say maui or the bahamas.
the problem is not if u ask her while at work or not.
it was really nice how he asked me out.
what a typical double standard you have set up!!
i cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good.
yes be disappointed and be mad!!
there was his stop so he got off the train.
_num_ years down the road that is all you can be so start from the beginning
don't be afraid to say no.
leave it alone-i don't care what she says, she's in enough pain.
for one thing if it doesn't work out there goes your job.
going to a club and dancing.
man how many times i passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying no......
how do i get he to stop nagging me and leave me alone.
when you _num_ or _num_ because when they said something they dont mean it
i would wonder why he shaved them but, in the end, they're his legs!
be really nice and give eye contact and smile a lot.. hope this helps!
i am just curious to what everyone thinks.
for the guys: (a) do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
she definitely wants you to think she's good looking, but she doesn't want that to be reason #_num_
only that i can say: good luck!
i only once told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
then go pick them up (if she say yes).
chances r, if u like her as a friend, ull like her as more.
keeping secrets only hurt the ones you love.
be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
don't worry what people will say.
and any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
let him go... either that or date his brother!
death is like a box full of candy corn
some do, but i would rather have a pair that were not too big
others like think due to society dictates its; i say screw society and give me thick!
that only makes her easier to bed.
if you like him that much,call him.
b/c you dont have any decision power what to do
it's your own life, as you said.
keep getting her younger and younger guys as one gets old get a new one for her...
ps im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl.
am doing this just for the points lol
thats a chance your gonna have to take.
work at it but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
whatever you do...do not tell him too soon!!!
i dont think it is wise to date at work.
if going to a movie is special for the _num_ of you, then do that.
it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay.
a sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
its a man thing live with it ego
i totally agree with udaman...good luck girl
i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away.
only i am not thinking about him but i am having dreams about him.
least not till he gets another girlfriend.
play the field a bit now.
i always say that you shouldn't do things if your gonna regret them later.
the safest rules of internet dating are these: _num_ chat via email and messenger _num_ chat on the phone.
yes i have done it it was a lot of fun.
there are tons of cheap ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it!
so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
keep seaching for a believer in romance, she's out there!
when you can fart in front of the one your dating
i hope i see some of it soon.
well just go up to her.
well i dont no how old you are which would help.
yes it is a sick habit
we have no room for screwed up animals like this in our society.
do you mean seem more sexy?
is this a trick question ?
it's like saying, what's got to stop me when i have already done it?
the right date can save money on lots of things.
thats all i have _num_ say.
why can't men (or boys in your case) ever say the word love?
and the gf should accept that about if she loves you.
he then asked me, can i come with you?
a lot of guys like that - just looking for sex.
a spasm in your back usually
i dont think so, maybe they should try taking our last names
becuz if you do then your gonna lose your friend over a guy!!!!
if he likes you, you'll know!
they like the challange i know thats what i love about it
if she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
but i need to be happy.
do not try to have sex.
when i fall in love, i feel stupid.
is worth the wait when you are ready.
you are too good for them
'...does this mean he likes me?.
but you know what, i feel the guy should make the first move.
if i would've kept my last name its just a freakin name.
seperate the bad thing and move on!
>>other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
look, try and get out to meet people.
i'm still in love with my ex and i'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
so it was a good ideea!
celebrate valentine with joy and fun...give eachother gifts and hav a fun...
not for anything but lookin at
oh yes, the trick ass hoe's never had a chance.
but i think they both like me.
cuz they like the little titis and pussys
dont forget to choose and vote for best answer!!!
i've been with my husband for _num_ years we recently got married in december of _num_
nay pier is a great place or one of the museums....there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels.
well, in my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
don't worry, i aint working with much either.
my mom books them all of the time pat@alanatvl.com
it's been over _num_ months & i can't seem to get over it.
tell her to move to mass.............
to me it realy dose'nt matter, but a hand full is quite enought for me.
some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them...something that lasts.
she's strong and loving and most of all...really wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
size, shape,looks, ect should not matter at all...
about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops?
i agree, just kiss him... he'll respond one way or another.
he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number.
if you want to enjoy a bit - why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms etc
so id say, they do work out, just not a lot of the times...hope this helps...
yah look me up if you are ever in florida lol!!!
be cool and ask her on a date!
hey im sorry i don't know and i wish best of luck to both of you!
hello: i am looking to visit your country.
look for another hot girl, so she will be jealous.
child please, dont ask that question if you dont want your feelings hurt
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him.
and last but not least--- does he always just happen to be staring...?
slow down the pace maybe, fourplay,
depends on the girl i guess... fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
i was not gonna let her win.
never tell her she's fat big one!!!
what happened when the politician took viagra?
you know that's if u didn't play the guilt trip.
it sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away.
ummm yes i do i think anyone does!!
because some couples never get to that comfortable boring stage.
obviously, men ain't much better ;-)
i never went out with him a second time.
maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen.
u need to be wit that person, you have found your true love
if the guy is worthy enough, u wont need to
your too young to be talking about kissing already.
first you order one online and the stork brings one to you
just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
just move on with your life and frind some one eles!
depends on how old they are.
well all ur missing is a million dollar smile..:)
well basically you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him
the girls that whine that flowers don't last are just ungrateful.
haha thats why i am single!
the girlz that are pretty or have a great personality.
altho, i dont really like girls all that much.
cut your cousin an your ex boyfriend off complete.
i dont ever remember giving a girl a cristmas gift unless i liked her.
whos to say that country girls feel more sexy?
well i met mine in a carnival.
honey my husband likes me for me.
nope, she is not a liar.
if they don't, it's time to move on.
figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
as long as he dosent mind , who elses opinion matters?
you're probably just too good for him anyway.
and she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons!!!!!
lime green would be more for a summer wedding.
i don't know can i do anything about it?
that's right, the right relationship happened on it's own.
looks don't really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
please be honest with me i can handle the truth
start the day off with breakfast out...then perhaps a nice walk.
i did this before (accidentally) and my friend was mad that i deleted him!
yes, girl down there, don't have sex.
ok, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
no.u guys kiss when ur ready
ask her questions (don't just talk).
i think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot.
when she calls, text her back
no!no!no!it certainly is most uncool.u r simply wasting ur health cos girls just hate it.
find someone u like and say will u be my valentine!
tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
if nothing work ... u have to ask him for it again :-)
some do,some don't have it in them.
he wont turn you down .
no brainer oh and nice picture of george clooney on your profile lmao
he wants me to change how i look.
ok, those other replies are just cocky, i'm way more fine.
bad teeth , bad breath and bad bo.
there are not any words that are going to make it any better.
dang it, if only every man knew what women want the world would be a much happier place!!!
and you want to suck another man's d**k???
you people have no right to get married!
yeah, im a guy so i dont really have to pay.
you know.......if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.......sheesh!
just be her bff _num_ real.
do you really want an answer?
men fake love to get laid, women fake orgasms to get love.
i wasn't trying to be a jerk.
it's a little less than _num_ at the start, but once you get to know each other, _num_ seems more likely.
some ladies just hint at what they want and expect the men to figure it out.
how about we grab some starbucks and talk, and see what happens?
i hate seeing my daddy sad :(
ask him if u should go see a dr.
post more ?s on yahoo answers
dontcha think he has enough to worry about?
i dont think he'll step out or dip if you dont slap skins with him
will i feel dat fo eva
but he mite like all that teasing and skeezin with no pleasin
you needs _num_ try agin
some men will shave for the right chick
if u like him smile and speak nice.
he likes ya but i don't know about love.
i'd date ya,but i'm in oregon and don't know where ur at.
im too picky, about people, how do i stop?
that sounds pretty girly
if the good is better than the bad, its worth it
only if both of you agree
this girl michelle who don't care if her name's in it, said she didn't buy it for a second.
well why u gotta like the one boy who messes wit u?
and, brothas don't b knowin how much dey need u until u gon.
if a dude hits on u don't be scared to say no
do i want luv
that what i called it but why idk
if you give them creepy looks they'll think ur leering
you're right it's realy confusing
how i convince my lover to show his love for me??
i mean, if you're that into them, sure
dun sell yourself out, girl, his money don't matter that much
don't let these girls hurt your feelings, you sound like an upstanding dude
i dunno, but there's another site that i go to for that
nah, man, think hard about how many arrogant chicks there are around
you could look easy if you don't have a guy.
then he's like do you want to use my chapstick?
take her hands and look in her eyes and say it if you mean it.
don't ever let a guy treat you bad.
don't think so, he's too big and i'm a weakling.
tell him when and if he says yes!
what mistake did u make?
tehres a song by king called only your mother loves you
why do we stay when theyre mean to us after we've falllen in love?
if youve done it, how was it?
its not really a turnoff when she gets super drunk
i guess if thats what you want
its just like trying to ditch a bad drug habit
i need to try that dating trick next time for sure
just let me know what you want
yall are both good with how things are going so thats good.
dont let her take over ur life, she will just have to deal!!
if hes not into you, there are plenty of other men out there who are.
no guy can give you everything you want...
you need to "find urself" if you wanna stay married.
start with a boring question and just keep it going!
ask if they want to travel somewhere with you.
just put some trust in him, and let it go.
i'm building up the courage to go for it.
find the person who loves you as much as you love them.
i'll be your girl if you come to my town.
stay far far away from him.
it's your choice man, but i hate all of them.
i say around _num_ or _num_
i don't know..do you want something shoved in your butt?
he told that woman he's a player.
my ex's made me realize why my wife was "the one".
don't be greedy and take both of them at the same time.
having sex is not the only thing that matters in life.
i use yahoo for my email and it works fine for me.
its just fun for me
he was a little busy after
thats just fucking sex
dont let her know you think shes hot
sounds like you're goin thru a lot right now
but u should ask a girl about the symptoms bc im a boy
i use to always feel the same thing but everything changed when i met my true luv!!
men are dumb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! who the hell know what theyre thinking when then do what they do
marry your bf if it doesn't work with anyone else. good choice
well i don’t want to just run up and ask will you go oit with me??
unless you reaaalllyyy know the guy your gonna get hurt.
redo it the same way you did it put it in there
your beliefs aren’t good or bad.
they're annoying all day.
go to hawaii or pay someone.
their intelligence, their character, and looks make up for how attractive they are.
i can just forget about him like it's nothing.
is it like a clear liquid that gets yellow when it ends up drying?
do you hate it if she sits on you bff's lap when drunk?
if it was before u were dating, he wasn’t cheating
he was a control freak
one of the gifts we can give ourselves - determination.
you should only marry a man after you been with him for _num_ yrs.
to my girls at cone, hi and hugzzz!!!
be yourself at all times
say it slow and repeat
a perv hit on me
some dudes are dumb
there are plenty of fish in the sea
either make up or move on
dude you've never talked to her, how can you love her
finda cute girl who can sing
you arent a slut
true love will happen to you, this time.
look up the answer on your own, dude.
_num_ months, and they will have moved on from you.
you won't even be able to tell what color it is once time has passed.
he wants to know if u like him
if she doesnt like u.....
your not a slut. dont fret
u cant force another to like u
break up and focus on others
have you had a pap smear?
i can say "yes" and i have long black hair and i'm proud!
my friend is in the same position...
maybe your young... idk.
i’m anonymous but i’ve been working with this person for a while.
i don’t get the question, someone answer.
if you love him for real, you’ll tell him
if you really like her, go with your feelings
if you think u can afford it, go for it if you want
stay alive and get things back to normal
what are you saying about her
not flirt. no one likes it
i think some women would tell you that it's pretty hurtful
tell him what you're all about. you always hear that, but they never do it. take the plunge and just say it.
it's be easier if i were more pissed off!!!!_num_
if they've forgotten about you, then forget about them too
your punishment - no tv for a month.
you've known each other for a long time it won't seem crazy
that's just the way she is. u could try it or just keep watching.
i still don't get it. can u say it again?
u have to give them a chance to see all your talents
wrong man could be a problem
my bf doesnt want to lose me cause he loves me a lot

i like this guy, dunno if it's just a crush or love.
if he keeps it up, you can tell he was only after sex
if i try and can see a reality that isn't real
i love have fun wit you so i answered this ?
give your bro som $$ and get rid of him
you can try to think about life without them, that's something.
if u wanna be around her so much then u have to prioritize it

men cheat more than women
save money on flowers

looks are decieving, he may be a shitty boyfriend
she may think that looks stupid. to me, blue looks better.
you can make a citizen's arrest.
having a huge package doesn't mean you're good at doing it!
yes, it looks so hot on almost any woman!
dudes can't keep secrets worth af

get over your fear and tell him
why the f would i drive _num_ hours to spend time with somoene unless i really liked her?
aint she got friends to talk on the phone with her?
it's good to play sports with other guys.
when you fall in love everything feels wonderful and you can't stop thinking about your bae.
i can't imagine a life without my hubby.
it's easy to hurt those we love most.
go for it if you both feel that way when you're grown.
chicks want to hear the truth so tell her. good luck with that!
you fight all the time, do you want to spend your life doing that.
when i call you a man take that with a grain of salt.
i like small cups of a and b.
the hot girls are by the hideous men.
i want someone younger then me by _num_ years, why the hell would i want someone older?
i am with them and it happened to me.
tell the truth about your feelings for her.
you should show her your naked baby pictures.
why is marriage important to the gay community?
we had sex on the hood of my car while it drizzled around us.
why do guys gotta grow up if girls don't expect them to?
you gotta do this a few times.
making love is like a fantasy.
rite now i think hes mad, and doesnt wanna be with u.
lemme know if youve got the answer plz!
red is a love color, nblack is a death color, etc.
i like fat ones, otherwise i feel like im missing out!

he'll try to make it up, you'll like it.
if he's picking on you he likes ya!

go with the best thing for you two.
look at like this, you got a real number not fake :)
i don't think you fool around.
they should get married if they can't keep their hands off each other.
seems like she's calling him all the time.
might as well keep on keeping on
how many loveless relationships have you been in?
is it right to break up with him cause of his mom
make a move and if she doesnt, give her space
they got married fast! _num_ fast!
ask about them and they make tell you, so just be yourself.
show her your skills man.
you look like a freak.
i give props to that culture, because they really have it down pat.
you'll never know for sure unless you ask.
i'd love to now what you think, thanks.
don't worry about it or over think it.
what you think the worst could be?
i don't even know what to do cus i can't stand when the girl is like that, so like what do i do now?
find somebody else somebody down that don't hate you all the time.
dont be a dick
girls are way more discreet than guys
some guys just can't dance
these youngins r dumb.
you got a kid. r u hitched?
depends did ya trust him _num_
fat and ugly guys can't b picky.
people choose marriage _num_ a reason.
it’s not worth arguing with you all the time
good luck asking your cell mate that question
do i like you?
some women are bi curious like me.
_num_ to _num_, just not younger than you.
its easy. treat them nicely
after this you can make a decision
pickup lines are emabrrassing. be yourself. girls like that.
he cheated, so i can lift my husband
look on the bright side
is your goal to just hang out
in my opinion he would make a good valentine
with so many temptations i am not sure i can do it.
it takes what? a yr to feel comfy in relationshipz?
i u ready, then cool
hello yea i'm tryna meet chicks.
it is what it is.
you need to have safety precautions when you friend total strangers on the net.
can you picture having kids with that guy?
if he isn't interested in you, it's his loss, and why date a fool anyway?
you usually learn the best lessons when you go for it, and make mistakes.
you did marry him for love i hope.
whatever the lady wants she gets. so ask her?
at least i have someone who will be there for me right at home.
relax and get a massage and just let it all go.
where should i even start here.
depends, are you hot with a _num_ body???
wait .. you mean yr avatar?
spend all day together then give him a foot massage ;)
he'll call if he cares
she thinks yr desperate cuz of the way you act
there is a idfference between fucking and making love
i haev four kids. being a homremaker is harder than my actual job
u dont gotta stay together even if u got a kid
are u a country girl?? ior are u from the city
getting married and having kids can wait. studying cant
you wanna be in a relationship with the same guy?
can you have sex with pamela anderson often?

he seems shy, so you outta make the first move.

if you have a threesome, you'll probably get the rough sex you're looking for.
let's practice our kissing! where is your house?
you may think it's no, but it's def yes!
dont rage on me but maybe, as your name is freakgirl on here but if you show a pic , maybe not.
that's for boys to do - not men.
if u wanted u could ask them out and see.
and that did happen _num_ to me .
don't make up some need in yur head to go out with that dude.
if he was the right guy, you wouldn't need to ask.
hope this streak never ends~
girls just want guys to be straight with their feelings.
nothin' like sex to bring out the passion in a woman
chicks like to be impressed so keep on impressing her
getting close and kissing me softly on me forehead.
that ain’t me but i know peeps like that.
she only worries about herself, nope that shouldn’t happen the first time.
depends on how hard you’re falling for this bro!
i just want to thank you ahead of time for the encouragement.
i just don't know why they want to get married so bad.
we like to be pursued, but with a light touch.
i ended up marrying him, but i wonder if you know why, other than love.
i think theme parks and museums are both fun places to visit.
i need to kno if im in love with this person or not.
do you like manicures or fake nails??
plan what u want, and dont worry about what everyone else wants.
but now we do all sorts of things together, and i dont know what to do.
i dont know what ur saring.
he tole me he still likes me, but his actions sure dont show it
ur perfume turns me on
practice unwraping starbursts with your tongue, women love it!
i don't think most men care but it depends on the guy.
its got nothing to do w/ being vulnerable or young or submissive...
don't get married so early in your relationship...
your not a good person if you plan on cheating on your wife!!
be the best you that you can be and see if he likes it.
hes the only one for you.
don't be a homewrecker. he's taken.
tell her that it's bs she makes you daily check in!
neighbor asked me out when i moved in
most teen guys prefer teen gals who like hooking up...
he played a good game of b-ball.
do u love fighting or what?
if he started liking u over her he prob would have ended it with her to be with u
important thing is to not try to get revenge on people who wronged u
a guy willing to move _num_ and _num_ for me
have you gone to the doctor yet?
she's not annoying but she was totally thin.
get a god dang life and leave me along.
that's like eating too much chocolate and saying you gained too much.
i was there and he was there.
no ball and chain, then do it!
these sorts of guys turn into wife beaters if you don’t give them what they want....
so do you think he’s cute or not?
well if you’re certain then tell the parentals that you haven’t yet.
a lot of people are going to tell you no..
does he feel the same about you?
some guys don't use that word unless they mean it.
tell him how you feel if you think he likes you.
i think everyone should keep their own name
boys come and go but friends are forever!!!
try and imagine that it was love <_num_
i think you'll be ready even if your relationship survives the _num_ seasons...
okay, well right now some guys like that kind of women and other don't
if you want kids, be a house mom.
young boys and older women, yes or no?
he wanted to keep going.
you gotta stay true to your husband, be faithful.
u cant use another word for love
self image is important
im a girl and i say such things
girls can be perverted too
yeah i like flowers but they die too quick :p
theres some films i havent seen
she's super sweet, exactly what yr after!
use your brain and not whats in yr pants, she might not love you
don't take this the wrong way, but i've never heard of a guy with a name that girly.
i'm not gonna waste my time returning his call.
i wasn't really feeling any of the ladies in my list, so i settled for my neighbor's wifey.
openness and honesty are the core of any marriage.
just ignore what anyone else suggests.
how do i impress her?
a rose says i love you
dont worry, it's weird, not bad
figure out what works for both of you.
she’s enough of a woman but she ain’t classy like us.
yep, especially after she got really sick....
bc you know, search for your love but be careful.
can’t help you anymore unless you give me mor info.
there’s no way to be good or bad at kissing.
just think it out
having fun with dudes is okay
think about some of the things you like doing and do it to them, like using you're tongue
they were my friend before they were my spouse. that makes it great.
that's probably more of a trust issue
i need help understanding this.
move on, there are plenty of fish in the sea.
he probably wasn't into it either.
when you can, make it yourself.
u do anything else than work & fix stuff?
i let her know that i really luv her.
the uppers think the frosh gals are easy game. thats messed up!
should i really just kiss'em?
it should be in the deleted stuff if you take a peek.
i hope you find a cute girl
thats a bad idea, its not for that purpose
its a long ass list
brokeback mountain, youd like it even if youre a guy
if its not dependent on sex, thats fine
i'll prolly tell her soon... she's my bff, y'know? any help would be appreciated
yah, but it's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony, y'know?
hold on and godspeed!
uh, just a small family thing at my house
if you're concerned about the performance, don't go through with it
it depends on age and upbringing
you need to choose your kid's last name
kid's life is hard without a dad
baldies look like kids, it's ugly
give it a chance, you only risk making it more difficult to be friends.
the last games score was...?
choose the guy you're with, or your ex.
best and easiest is fly or drive to vegas and get hitched.
yes i just wanna get to know u
size c or d at the most but the rest new much
lie to them and then just keep lying!
it’s double the pleasure since they haven’t performed before
my wife doesn’t like wearing those brands
we have no idea what u look like
opposites attract, we can always find a life partner if we look hard enough
lol, this is def better than my everyday life
eh, you went with your ex there, don't go there with your new date, too
talk to your bff and find out if it's all good
weird, but it worked for me in about _num_ to _num_ days or so
it annoys me when you get teased by him about everything!!
no, i'm still unmarried.
a lot of dudes like big chicks, mostly black guys
i luv writing poems for the ladies...u done this for your lady friends _num_?
i told her im into her and she didnt want to mess up our friendship
shouldnt matter. you like him then say
do they throw shade when youre together?
i like those. and since im a guy, i dont need to have a adate
dont get married if u feel leike that
it depends if they are in vain
move on and date someone who likes u
get to know her and then ask the other out
i asked if he blowed me off
nasty old guys like young asians
do what you want!
hmm, tell him you just wanna keep this casual...
you should be happy unless he isn't treating you well?
thats a hard situation and there aren't any easy answers!
they have been hard but good years.
we seen each other eberyday for like _num_ or _num_ years!
if i am the guy you want then be wit me!
live a little and flirt!
stay with what u feel inside.
is it bad if i havent kissed her since we started dating _num_ months
they look better than other countries
itll be okay the next day
ask her out for dinner and a movie.
some guys don't think about it they just do it.
speak english please. i can't understand you.
sorry i don't feel that way.
just remember that a bird can't fly with only one wing
yeah i think about this a lot
if you're just whatever about it you'll never find anyone to date
there's this girl that i met and i'm wondering if she likes me
dont just wait around for the call
quit your bitching, nobody cares if you're gay
lots of women in their early _num_ date men that are in their late _num_, and in turn some men of their age date younger women
break up with him if he cant get it together
it's possible he loves you and will end up letting his dad down.
stay strong! never apologize when you haven't even made a mistake
fix it before you regret it.... time is a-wasting.
this chick thinks bad boys are way over-rated.
i wanna hear what a black chick would say about this.
help me beat her in this debate.
almost all of those guys are near your age.
when will people realize and notice shit.
i'm not sure what i should do.
you go and get wasted at the bar.
i acted like that with my new lover
if you have to ask, forget about it.
don't wait for him to see you're the one that's good.
ugh, still stuck w/ this even though getting divorced
you got this - have fun.
your bae will just think your being an ass.
you can't fix what's going on w/ her parents, but maybe what's going on with friends? why?
right now i wouldn't marry any girl who does'nt want to change her last name for me, but thats just how i feel.
why don't you try dating chicks if you can't stand dating guys.
my dirty ex cheated on me after _num_ full years
you will know soon enough. after six month see what happens.
the one i thought was good goes a little something like this.
not all dudes dumb chicks
its always tons of stuff to do over there
is it ight to smooch on the _num_ date?
i got a homegirl i'm close with
they in lust *lol
when he does, tell him it was a mistake tp breaup
my friend says im too nice and i should say no
there is always an exception
not all men, but some o
if u do that, u keep ur last name
just walk up, introduce yourself, and ask if she's available.
i was all hot and bothered, but i got out of there quick.
big girls can still be total cuties.
not everybody here is a student
unwrap starburst and tie cherry stems with your tongue for practice
he will think he is going to marry you if you talk to him for another week
vote for me in best answer and ill pay for you
look in public, youll feel more comfortable
just flirt with him and see what happens
also it takes the pressure off me to ask somebody
come on! go out with me plz!!
she's not gonna forget that i messed up.
how do i make it seem i want more than sex?
i'm a guy i know about this stuff.
dont worry. ur _num_
go fon a trail with a friend
it u love each other, itll work out
eye contact is improtant
i can lift him no problem
he needs to regain your trust and start completely over again
i get it. i had the same ex in _num_, _num_ and _num_ grade
are you sure you want to ask her out?
i hope u get the info soon
play truth or dare together
wait till uno for sure. then decide
thats dumb. u just need a theory class
quit if u eat something like that
i keep thinking about fucking her
u will only know if u ask him directly
jamie will ask out rubi
its still happening cause neither has courage to end it
maybe they just dig learning about that stuff.
he's dribbling the ball, he shoots annnnnnd score, _num_ points for the champion.
do dudes really want big girls over other types?
i know he loves you like you like you love him, but no one knows the future.
if he respects you, he will understand what u need.
we have our own sins started.
his answer was good enought for me.
love him sure, but let him go.
smart chicks are sexy!
it' nasty having to take her too.
my sis closes her eyes _num_ she kisses.
in a roundabout i met bf
he not gettin married this month
should i jus let it go or nah
why u bringing everything up bout me
it sounds like you guys are already married
first, why didnt they end the relationship?
give him some space he may call you back
one step at a time. think about how he lost something good.
ask harold when you're gonna go to dinner.
not if you have to ask.
you can still come home or call friends and family but you gotta go to school.
i will never get laid again
let him come over and do the talking
some people don do that because of church
you should feel good.
people only choose to do what they feel comfortable doing.
think about it and, and decide if you can trust him!
i wasn't saying "do you think women are sexy and beautiful."
are they going to be violent, qask them
you enjoy selling your self to much
see if he will go out of his way
it has a deffention of being able to go out of your way for another.
they dont kow antyhing about you, how would they know
who cares what they think.
if you could pick _num_ traits for your girl what would they be?
we like guys who think of us.
i feel excited but weird.
just stay cool! it can help to be a littl hard to get
do you see the way that girl walks?
he totally shouldn't care if ya'll are at a dance together
chicks like confident dudes, yeah?
ask her out again after class is over, dude
you need to get into counseling asap
i'm pretty sure i still got lovey feelings for him, tho
that's fine, tho. i'm generous, if you get my meaning
if you wanna get something you're stuck with, then go for it.
you've only met the guys with one thing on their mind.
i'm not saying you have to stop getting your freak on till then.
if he doesn't feel like dancing, don't push it.
i'm a dude, so lemme tell you what i've learned.
i don't even know why my gf won't tell me she loves me to my face.
i have no idea if she really means it or not.
help!! i don't know to get to know her.

different strokes for different folks, but some guys like fat women no one would fight them over.

you gotta get yourself ready to let her go...
sometimes i talk about my problems too early in a relationship.. maybe i told him too much

i think you need to compliment her, find out her name and just be smooth as butter and a normal person.

girls dont like it. they think men who smoke are filthy cause they are dieing
i only act normal around guys i dont like. you know
the older man timing was off
bring them both on a date
im a maid of honor. it ust be perfect
my dude snores so i can never sleep!

if you dont make it known you want her forever, it will work out better that way.
let he rknow to only call if it's important.
i gotta stop cuz im about to relieve myself for real.
after _num_ days... with me you're a distant memory.

i agree with the other guy, now lets stop before anyone gets hurt.
no one likes to be kept on a string and toyed with like a yo-yo.

impress her with attention and love
men have dicks. women have clits
ur love for ur wife should be limitless
i don't want a high maintenance chick,just a trustworthy one

just talk it over with your hubby.
all u have to do if bat your eyes at him. that's it. done deal.
just go ahead and tell her and live happily ever after.
asking that really killed the moment....you ever think of trying something enjoyable together??
also kissing and seeing if you’re good at it.
jules sac is hilarious and crude too.
i think when a man can’t get over himself it’s pretty unattractive.
i'm just like ur wife so i know!
if u ask others, i don't think ur ready to
rip your shirt off and yell like tarzan ;)
if you don't love ur husband, move on and make room for another _num_
give her an honest compliment
oo i am also into a guy in _num_ grade!
they feel insecure when their around guys who aren't as educated
maybe we can go on a date and fall in love!
if she tells them, ill be kicked out cause its pakistan and not the us
my friend is dating someone online
i want to cuddle a fat girl
i think the bomb is better
we hung out with bob's dad from his side of our family.
things that take forever to move.
be friends first and then let the relationship go natural.
for the three years of my relationship i was cheated on.
go at him because he likes another girl?
don't let them know until your already in bed together.
that's not a big deal in america.
always listen to what people say. don't act to full of yourself, but be confident.
yep, i dated someone just like that.
i wish i listened to my friends advice
if hes throwing a mood, ignore him
do what makes you happy
we tried to move it but didn't work
if you don't ask someone else probably will.
my twin won't listen to me or talk to me.
girls are polite, she'll answer.
there was a reason you married him.
just ask him if he wants to see a movie ... how hard is that?
women dont always find men their age very attractive
doesnt matter, we're just friends anyway
you should take some self defense classes
that's what it's like, amirite?
how smashed is this chick
you oughta get to know em both before datin either of em.
girl he crushin on u hard!!!
you can join a chat room thats got video _num_
good times man, good times.
if u cheat, he gonna cheat...
white women are appropriating men in general.
it would make me crazy if she called _num_ times a day.
you're probably the only one he's having sex with.
tell them to leave.
how old r u
they cant control the lives of others
let him go if u like him
someone i can just be me around.
the rest is cakkkkeeeeee!
say i love you and if they say it back you know its real.
just ended a _num_ relationship with my baby daddy.
wishing you luck searching for your one!
i love him still after all this time.
did he say anything? he knows you care.
people think different about who is attractive.
my other half is forgiving.
he tryna be fab with u?
i guess hypothetically yo would date me if i was single.lol
males and females be tripping
she a user so run
stay away from the hit that will fuck u up
you'd be amazed at the kind of people that are drawn to that guy
don't do it until you get to _num_ yrs old, don't worry, you'll still be appealing then
if you're sure about that, then do it that way
do dudes even know what they want from a relationship at all?
ur gonna have bad times if ya need ur ex emotionally.
if are ok with it, go with it.
don't forget, till death do you part.
ain't nothing wrong with her asking for your digits.
if the answer is yes, what's with these girls saying flowers don't last?
don't be talking about her looks.
asking her that shouldn't bother her if you guys are in a serious relationship
i say maui or the bahamas...
the problem is whether your gonna ask her out at work or not
the way he asked me out was so nice!!!
um, youre setting up a double-standard.
i can't give you a wife-based view, but i can give you my view, which is hopefully as good.
you have every right to feel angry and sad.
he got to his station and hopped off the train
start from the beginning and work down to _num_ years in the future...
say no! no fear!
let it be, she has had enough no matter what she say
kiss your job goodbye if you are wrong!
try getting down at tha club!
i missed out on a lot of good stuff by keepin my head in the clouds
how can i make him shove off?
when you're _num_-_num_ you more likely to just say crap and not mean it
why the hell did he shave his legs???
be nice, look em in the eyes and smile
why does everyone else thinkg about this
guys, what size girls do you like
she doesnt want you to like her only for her body
gl is all i can say
there was only one girl i truly lvoed
if yes, go get em
if u want her to be a friend, ud like a deeper relationship more
u gonna hurt ppl u love with them secrets
be your self and don't be simpin cause thats what chicks like
forget what the haters got to say
dudes that say they will, aint being honest
his brothers better, forget him!
dead be likes some box-full uh candy co'n. 's coo', bro. it gives ya' cavities.
i would not wants' some pair dat big
oders likes t'believe due t'de way society dictates it. ah' recon' we should rebel against society and appreciate curvia' honky chicks.
dat only makes ha' easia' t'gotss' sexual intercourse wid.
call him if ya' feel dat level uh attracshun t'him. 's coo', bro.
its cause you dont have decision making power
its your life. do what u want
the older you fet the better you feel
fyi, i dont like a woman who eats romantic dinner at home
i just do this for the points, y'know?
you gotta take the risk, y'know
work on your relationship with him, just don't let him isolate you at the house
dude idc what you do, don't tell him yet!
it's not smart to date people you meet at work
go for a movie if u both want to
it happens after threeplay and before fiveplay
buy a sex toy that ud both like
you gotta deal with every mans ego.
i wanna win him over instead of pushing him away because i like him that much.
i dont think of him but i do dream of him
not until he finds someone new
date some new ppl
dont do something ull regret
the safest way to date online is chat through e-mail and over the phone
i finished up and it was a trip, man
there's lots of cheap ideas to run across, just pick what you're interested in and get w ith it
maybe there's plenty of guys that would think the world of you, you're just missing them
keep looking, you'll find the right chick eventually!
you know you belong together if you can fart around each other.
i hope i see some of it shortly.
just go up and start talking to her.
i dont know ur age, would would be nice
yes. it is not a good habit
society has no place for ppl like this
u mean 'seems more slutty'
thats a trick question
its like saying what gonna stop me after i already did it
the right date can save lotta cash
thats all i gotta say
why cant guys just say love
your girlfriend should just accept that if she loves you
then he asked if he could come with me
so many guys just want sex!
a spasm in the back is what usually causes it.
they should take our last names i think.
you pick a guy over your friend.
you'll know if he likes you.
i like that they go for the challenge.
make her media content
i wanna be happy
nah don't try to hit
when i love its hella embarrassing
it'll be worth it when u ready
u too good for em
so is he checkin for me orrrr...?
men gotta take the first step in the rship imo!
i woulda kept my last name if i could damit!
take out the bad and let it go yo!
ask him how he's doing sometimes.
try doing new things to meet people.
i'm not over my ex yet but now he likes my cousin...i'm furious.
it ended up being a good idea.
celebrate v day with lolz, presents and fun!!!
nope other than their looks.

find a hot girl and make her jealous.
don’t ask if you can’t accept the answer
i am completely stuck and need help because she knows i care so much about him.
finally, does he always stare at you?
maybe try some foreplay to take it slow :)
usually girls with light skin look more pale when they get black hair
there was no way i would lose to her.
telling her she's fat is a serious no no.
you wanna hear this awesomely bad joke i got?
if you weren't playing the guilt trip card, you know it would happen.
seems like he has to much fun while your gone.
of course anyone would too!
some couples will never be that close with each other.
clearly dudes aren’t any better.
no second date i went on wit him
perhaps since you are thuh most attractive young lady they have ever encountered
you found them and need to stick with them for love.
if he's good enough for you, then you won't have to.
talk about kissing when you're older.
order it online, the stork will work its magic
the older you get the harder it becomes.
just move forward and get a new person.

when you break the news, do it nicely.

just keep asking her questions, then u don't have to even talk.
im guessing she loves u because u r a good person.
she calls, text her back
no dont do it, its not good, youre wasting your time and health
ask someone you like to be your valentine
tell her you love and miss her
you just gotta keep asking until it gets done.
some just don't have what it takes, but others do.
there's no way he's gonna say no.
that's a decent shot of george clooney you got there.
my partner wants me to look different
those are cocky replies... i am a lot better-looking!

who want to blow a guy?
i dont wanna marry u
im a guy so i dont gotta pay
he can wear my pants if he asks
you have to actually be her friend, for real.

dudes just act like they love a chick to get booty, chicks just act like they like sex to get the attention
i didn't wanna be mean
i guess it'd be around _num_ to start with, but once you get to know them? maybe _num_
chicks like to beat around the bush instead of just saying what they want
let's grab some coffee, talk, and go from there

ah women are so complicated...
i'm too picky, i know, but i don't know how to stop!

king's song : only your mother loves you.
why be with him if he's mean to you?

her getting too drunk isn't a turnoff
only if that is what you want!
it's like pulling out of a drug addiction.

if u let her take over; she just gotta deal.
it's plenty of thirsty ass fish out there, so you'll be ight'!

men are dumb - no one understands why they act the way they do!
your bff could be a good person to marry if nothing else works out
i just wouldn't be able to walk up and say, how would you like to go out with me.
unless you know him like a brother, your really putting your neck in a noose.
it's easy, just put it back in place, just like you did the first time.
it can't be good or bad if you feel that strongly about it.
they’re an annoyance alllllll day....
two options; go to hawaii or just pay some one.
intelligence confidence, attractiveness and active ness are the biggest factors for attractiveness.

its a clear liquid that turns yellow when its dry

you gotta go back to the way things were, so u can stay alive
yo, she aint tryin to take that shit to the next level?!
flirting and what not isn't cute
i guess some girls would say it really hurts.
you've gotta speak up and tell him what you want, least that's what they tell me i've never tried.
it'd be lots easier if i was mad
if they've moved on then you probably should too
ur punishment is no tube for a month.
if ya tell him it won't be crazy, cuz you've known each other a long time.
that's the way she is- do it that way or just see what happens.

of everything i've experienced during life with my family, this is the most lovely.

i really like thsis boy but i'm not too sure if it is a cursh or if i'm truly in love.

give her shots of you in your birthday suit.
why do gays want to get hitched?
we did it on the hood of my car as it drizzled. fo shizzle!

if anyone knows the answer please lmk!
red is love, black is death, etc. etc. etc.
i like thicker ppl - thin ppl make me feel cheated!

loved him a lot, not sure if he loves you too.
do i break up with him cause of his mom?
make a move, she's into you or nit.

girls are curious about lesbian sex
_num_ is fine. its okay if she is not younger

well, he cheated, so i can carry my husband
just try to get the best out of it
do you think you want a new friend?
there's something about him that just screams "valentine!"
i feel like i keep getting tempted and it's tough being good.

it's ok to be online friends but gotta have limits
do u think u can picture having a family with him???
if he says no, hes not good enough to begin with
to tell u the truth youll learn. but u gotta experience life
hopefully.....you married yo boo cuz u love him.
it depends on the woman and what she want
i know i have someone waiting for me at home.

maybe you think no, but i think yes
if you show your face maybe not but since your name is freakgirl
only lil boyz not men
try something like would you like to hangout sometime
it could happen to anyone even me twice
you shouldn't feel obligated to go out with him
well obviously you don't want to be with him otherwise you wouldn't be asking me that.
i hope this doesn't end.
women just want a man to be open about his feelings.
women like to be more into sex.
keep trying to impress her.
lean towards me and give me a soft peck right on the forehead.
i'm not like that, but there's a lot of them out there.
she's self centered and that shouldn't show up on a first date.
it depends on how much you are starting to get into this boy.
thanks for the pep in advance!
why would they want to get married?!?
approach softly and chase us!
do you have any idea why i married my husband?
let's go to an amusement park or a museum.
i like this person but dont know if im in love

plan what u want. dont worry about others
we do these together.. .i dont know what to do now
i dont get u
he claims he still loves me but don't act like it
that perfume is dope
you should practice unwrapping starbursts with your tongue. chick dig it.
most men don't care i think, but it really depends on the person.
it has nothing to do with being weak, obedient, or naive.
don't get married too early in a relationship.
if you plan on cheating on your wife, you're not cool.
do the very best impression of yourself, and if he's down to clown he'll lip you up
you don't wanna be with anyone else but them
he's getting married, just stop
did you tell her that the day check-ins were annoying?
my neigbhor hit on me asap
most teen boys enjoy teen girls who like sex.
he played basketball well.
you must be a troll
if he liked you more than her, she'd have dumped him
fear, anger, revenge: these are the forces of the darkside
he loved me enough to close the long distant relationship from _num_ miles away to home
u been to a doc yet??
she's no shrew but that thin one was definitely!
dont waste my time...go do something!
its like eating too much chocolate and they bitchin that u got fat
i went there and he was there
go for it he single!
men like him will beat their wives if they don’t obey
do you think he’s hot or not??
if u haven’t yet, tell ur parents if you’re sure
sadly, you're going to get shut down by many people in your life.
do you think he's on the same page when it comes to the feels?
there's that four letter word that a man just can't say unless he really feels it.
he is totally digging you, so you gotta let him know.
i think everyone should keep their damn name.
friends are forever, guys sleep around tho.
think of it like love.
you gotta have your relationship ready for the four seasons.
some guys like some girls, not all types tho.
if you want kids be a stay at home mom.
what do u think of the young guy with the older woman?
he just keeps going
u promised to stay faithful when u got married. remember that.
it'd have to be love there's no alternative
your self image is also important though
well i'm a girl and i say them things
girls can be just as preverted ;)
flowers are nice, tho they don't last super long...
there are movies i still haven't seen
she is so sweet, def the person you are looking for!
hey, use your brain not your manhood - maybe she loves you!
ur name sounds like a chick's name, bruh... no diss, tho
meh, don't waste your time calling him back
no women i got the hots for around, i picked my neighbor's old lady instead!
not gonna have a good marriage without trust & communication, dude
don't listen to ppls advice, most of the time they wrong
what do you think i should do to get wit her?
maybe u should give a rose _num_ show ur love _num_ dem
it's weird but not bad weird.
find what's right for both of you, dude.
they're not kids but we're more mature by far.
yep, like when she puked.
cause you know you should look for your love but carefully!!!
need more info to help more...
kissing is kissing, theres no right or wrong to it.
think it over, don't rush the decision
it sok to have fun with guy friends
justthink about what you like and do it back ... bit like a tongue massage
my partner was my friend first and its perfect
i think its more of a trust problem tbh
i need help figuring this out!
u better move on if that man don't want u
he aint interested either...
diy is the way _num_ go
why do you always work and fix things?
i really meant it when i told her i loved her.
it just seems like all the male seniors think all freshmen girls are easy.
how do i just kiss him?
you should just check the deleted items, it might be there.
i think you'll find a nice chick to go out with eventually
bad idea, you're not there for that crap
the list is endless, tbh
brokebak mountain and stuff, but... you'll be ecstatic even if it is a dude
don't base your relationship on sex and you'll do fine
i'll tell her soon enough; she's my best friend after all and i know she will offer to help anyway.
you are correct sir! never ever ever look at your future wife before the wedding ceremony begins.
keep calm, hold on, and you'll do great!
uhh it's just a small party for close family members...
don't do it if you aren't sure about the performance portion.
i just got married actually.
it depends on how old they are and how they were raised.
youll have to decide a last name once u have kids.
your kid is gunna have a really rough time with no fathe rin its life.
men that dont have hair are ugly to me, they look like a kid lol.
give it time. if you leave that person, it will be harder to stay friends
find out the score of the last game
if you love him you need to get rid of your x
best way to get hitched ... cheap and quick in vegas!
i wanna know more about u
i like c or d size. nothing bigger
just lie and keep lying
i've never seen them perform so it extra awesome!
wife doesn't wear that mess
we don't know how you look!
opposites attract and every pot has its lid
i think its better than my personal life
dont go to the same places with her and you did with your ex
talk with your bro and see if its ok
thats odd.. it worked for me in _num_-_num_ days
it pisses me off when he teases you about small shit.
no, i am not hitched yet.
there are a ton of guys into big girls, and most are black men.
i usually use poems to express how i feel to women, and i wonder if anyone else has written one to someone special in their life.
i told her how i felt, and she told me she was afraid it would mess up our friendship.
stay with him if you care about him, and you shouldn't care what others think.
do they make fun of you when you and him are together?
i love them since i am a dude and no one said i needed a date.
don't get married if you feel this way.
depends on whether a person is full of themself...
ya gotta move on and find someone who doesn't hate ya...
you should be to know her and then one of you guys will ask the other out!
i asked him he was blowin me off...
maybe some younger sick guys like younger asian chicks.
make sure this is your choice.
tell him u want it casual
if he is not treating u well leave. u gotta be happy
its difficult and lots of problems
the past few years have been ok, but not always easy peasy.
srsly, it's been _num_, maybe _num_ years, and there hasn't been a day we haven't seen each other.
just think of me as the man of your dreams, and be mine.
it never hurt anyone to let their flirt flag fly!
stick to what you kno in your gut.
well... ive been with this one girl _num_ months and not kissed her, is it bad?
gotta be the girls decision!
imo theyre better looking than other countries
it'd be fine the day after
just see if shes free for dinner and a movie
some men are inconsiderate assholes when it comes to women
can you speak english i have no idea what yr saying
i have never felt that, soz
gotta memba, no bird ever flown w/ _num_ wing
i think bout this all the time
if u dont stop looking so down youll never find a significant other
i just met a chick and i wanna know if shes into it
keep busy while waiting for the phone to do its thing.
be yourself, don't change for anyone.
ladies who are _num_ want _num_ year old guys, but the _num_ year old guys want the ladies younger than that.
if he don't appreciate you, leave him.
he might really love you. or he's just doing it to hurt is dad.
don't be such a weakling. if you say sorry to him without doing anything wrong you just humiliate yourself.
do it before you run out of time
that girl doesn't need a man who is gonna betray her.
yo what a black girl say bout this
yo help me beat this chick at debate
they're pretty much dudes the same age as you, mostly
when are people ever going to understand?
really, what am i gonna do?
ya go to a bar and drink till your drunk!
i acted that way with my current bf
if you gotta ask... then no...
don't sit around waiting till he realizes how great you are
thought i divorced them but it still goes on....
have a good time it will be ok....
she will just think you are an ass if you do that.
if mom and pop don't like you just be friends with her friiends why?
for me - i woudn't marry a girl who woudn't change her last name but that's just me
you should try to date girls since guys offend you
my ex of _num_ years of being together cheated on me
eh, i say give it _num_ months - time will tell!!
here is how the one i like went
not all gentlemen break up
its fun to go there. lots to do
can u kiss on first date
i have a close female friend
the want to sex each other
explain that breaking up was a big mistake, and you want to be with him.
i am too nice according to my friends, and i should say no to him.
theres alway san exception right?
some guys do but not every single one.
if you do that then you will be able to keep your last name.
say hello and ask if she has a bf
that turned me on, but i left
fat girls can be hot
all tha ppl here are not here for school.
if u practice over & over u will be able to unwrap bothcherry stems and starbursts with ur tongue like me.
u keep talkin to him so much, he gonna think you r his wife!
if you gimme your vote for best answer, i will pay the bill.
looking in public is prolly the best idea, plus you will feel safe there..
tease him see if he bites....
then i don't have to ask anyone direct.
say yes it'll be fun!
she never forgets when i screw up.
how do i approach her so she doesn't think i'm a guy with bad intentions??
as a guy... let me enlighten you
no prob, you’re just _num_
trail ride with a friend every time all the time.
if it’s meant to be they everything will work out.
eye contact, it’s what it’s all abouut.
he's a weakling, i can pick him up!
he will have to start over to get your trust back.
my boyfriend and i were in second, fourth and eighth grades together.
why would you wanna go out with her?
hopefully you'll review this thoroughly.
play t or d together.
gotta confirm it and go from there.
that's dumb u need a theory class _num_ that.
quit if you eat something like that
i want some from that girl.
be blunt and confront him, that's how you will know
jamie's going to ask rubi out.
both of you need to have some guts and end this thing
could be interesting for them to learn about it...
he dribbles he shoots he scores!!! two points!
do guys really like big girls?
he def loves you too, but time will tell...
if he repsects you he'll get it
we're the source of our own sin
that response works for me
u can still like him. but move on
a smart girl is hot
its bad they cant take her out
my sister closes her eyes when she is ready to kiss
lol i met my last bf driving in a roundabout!
he’s getting hitched this month
should i move on and forget about it?
u replaying everything u did to me in your mind?
it is like ur married
why didnt u break up
he may want more space
you just gotta take it one step at a time and remember he got a good thing
u gotta say "hey booo when we goin to dinner?"
nah, not if u gotta ask
u gotta go _num_ school and u can still com home to ur friends and fam
i didn't wanna have sex ever agin
let him come to you. if you go to him, you'll look crazy about him
some people dont do that bc of their relgiion
i hope you're proud of yourself!
it's up to the individual, it's their choice.
if you think about it it might help you decide whether to trust him or not.
i didn't mean to ask if you thought of women as sexy and beautiful.
you need to ask if they feel like they're gonna hurt someone.
i think you really get off on selling yourself.
see if the guy you're into will make that extra effort.
you shouldn't take that to mean that you both are incapable of feeling for each other.
if they really don't know about you at all, then how would they know this?
who cares what people think
if you could have _num_ qualities in your chick, what would they be?
chicks like guys with brains.
i feel joy, weird, and odd.
keep cool, you might try being a little hard to get
look the way she walks
he shouldn't give a crap if you both are at a dance.
women go for men who are comfortable with themselves.
just go ask her if she'll go on a second date with you after class.
you definitely need to get checked out by a psychologist.
the love i feel for him is overwhelming, but i stand tall.
that's a-ok with me, and i'm defintely the giving type, if you pick up what i'm putting down.
go a'haid and get sump'ng dat ya' kinnot get rid of.
you's've only met dudes wid some specific preference.
but i's gotss'ta be not tellin' ya' dat ya' gotss'ta be celibate until den
do not fo'ce him t'boogy if he duz not wants' to.
i'm some man. 's coo', bro. i'll info'm ya' whut i'm aware of.
in our entuire relationship, my gf has not told me she loves me a single time!
no one knows if she sincerely means it or not.
please will you introduce me to her?
i love my long black hair. my husband loves my long black hair. no one cares about your opinion.
these days everyone decides really quick
maybe their trying too hard to be something they arent
no babe you wont, i was married to someone who was a complete bastard
keep away from this dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i just want a gf to hang out wiht me
it's been the best thing ever for me.
i met a guy one time and it was so romantic. we met during a huge rainstorm.
if you are willing to work more, you can make more.
could it ever be the same after that?
it could be, just choose one and know why you chose it
i just love my brown hair
buy some sporting goods or auto tools for a good gift for hubby
thats crap its not what you'll become just because she says you will
the last straw was when he cheated on me, it was the worse thing he could do
imagine what its like alone with him at night
i was bleeding and in pain
it can mean a whole ton of diff things
a _num_ yr break sounds nice.
eye contact is not enough.
you want all your friends with you _num_?
he acted bad, thats why i don't like him.
i know what i want in a girl
it happened in the river with ppl watching
if u hot show ur boobs
its natural wit him.
i go nuts when i see an ad for malaysia air on tv.
go out!! do everything u couldn't do when u were together! lol
it's possible to enjoy giving more than takin'.
should i have feelings still after _num_ months
resume foreplay if u r gonna cum
u will be attractive to men always
ask a girl in thailand. they r everywhere
it's crucial to make it for at least _num_-_num_ minutes!
i'm worried over how much i'm into him.
cuz it's buy one and take one.
i didnt know pakistan was not liberal
we wrestle and are good friends
i dont see him in school, but i do at bball games
you didnt tell us anything. where do u live
c'mon, tell me why you like this chick
just a different way to say they don't like u
eh, just about everybody breaks up eventually
i met my soul mate when i worked there for a bit
i'll probably go check it out.
don't wait, finish what you started.
there are way more men into bigger women than you think, lady.
honestly, i said it casually, and i didn't expect him to remember.
girls aren't into guys who all into themselves.
cds, dvds, depends on the device.
you are both hard working to do it well.
if she likes you, she will call.
you are on my mind all the time and i like you so much.
do ya think i should give him another chance?
if you think our love is going away, don't let it pass.
daniel doesnt read manga
if they aply, use these
been there, done that beau!
she tryin' to see other people?
pick ur fave one
be eyebally t'let ha' go.
i sometimes reveal details about mah' problems too early in some relashunship, and puh'haps ah' told dat dude too much.
id just proceed no matter whut
discard him, it wud be better.
at times, but you simply have to pay attention to your partner.
youll get the propcorn if he gets it first
who cares if its a rebound for you both
my girl is crazy, but i love her more for it
one day youll find the right guy
dont give up and stay strong now.
not that one pick -green or blue.
depends on the guy some will / others wont.
i want a kind and smart girl
it could be worst. at least its not bella
it is more _num_ percent or _num_ percent. not _num_
i still can't figure out what she wants.
my best friends hate my better half and want us to break up, it's not going to happen.
we really weren't spend that much time together.
didn't you release at least a thousand?
seems like my friends just want to kiss and kiss.
women think with their nugget
say something nice then ask her name, don't get freaky keep it cool
how long does it take before you realize you've wasted your time and she's not into it?
girls think guys who smoke are awful because they're basically committing suicide.
i can only really be me when i'm with guys i'm into into, but i'm sure you know what i mean.
it's not right the timing with the old man, you'll see!
bring em both out!
i'm my sister's only maid of honor and i demand it be perfect
i have trouble sleeping cause my bf snores like a pig!
it doesn't matter what they think. if they don't hit it off, they should stay apart.
you have a better chance of having her forever if ya don't tell her you want her forever.
tell her if it's only to shoot the breeze, not to call so often!
i gotta stop now before i pee my pants!
you could be out of my thoughts in about three days.
or do you just wanna make that clear?
i agree with that other person, so don't let anybody get hurt.
folks don't like being pulled in and pushed out.

dudes got dicks chicks got clits
love her for what she's done for you
i don't want a fake ass girl i want a real one who'll stay with me

where u meet these fillapina chicks?

nope, i prefer normal lookin.
she got nasty cuz i kept dating.
i need to move on but i love him.
yea ask permission and see how fast she turns violent.
only certain girls are good enough cuz men think they are special.
i need to get laie sometimes.
i've heard this a lot.
sounds like you're the boss of the house.
hang in there and find the one that likes you just the way you are.
don't go in there, it doesn't seem right.
it's not the size it's the looks!!!
if he comes back then it was meant to be, if not, like fonzy said; forget about 'em...
he's so hot and so angry with me.

let me see if you can kiss good come here let's see how you do it.

my friend has an online relationsip with someone.
cuddling with fat women is a great feeling.
i think the bomb is less complex.
i met his father from his side of the family.
everything that can move easily.
get to be friends, then go from there.
he cheated on me for three years.
beat on him cause he likes someone else?
i think it's better to keep sexy stuff a mystery until you actually go to bed together.
it's not really that important in the usa.
believe in yourself, but don't be stuck up, and look her in the eye and listen to her.
just let it flow like a river
i dated someone just like that, so i know that feel
i wish i listened to my friends
if he don't start acting right, leave him!
we tried to move foward, but it didn't work :(
have courage and go for it
im not talking to my sibling
she'll be polite if you ask
why did you marry him
just ask him to go the movies
lotsa women nowadays can't find dudes in their own age group they like
doesn't matter, we're just friends
well take some self defense classes then dude

white women are stealing all the men!
if she calls me _num_ times i day i’d go crazy!
you only hit that with you
tell that lazy ass to move out!
wow, how many years of age are yuh?
dey believe dat dey can control de lives of others when dey cannot.
yuh would let him go if yuh like him.
someone i can be myself around
the rest is easy
tell them "i love you" it will tell you how they feel
i just got out of a _num_ yr relationships with my baby daddy
hope you find your match.
time's passed and i still love him.
he knows and he hasn't said anything yet.
people like what they like.
she's forgiving, my wife.
whatll happen if u want him to be a casual lover
i like him and he would date me if i was single
woman are meaner than men
she could be using you
dont do stuff that can hurt you
ur would be surprised to ee who likes him
wait till ur _num_ u will still be great
thats what to do if u gotta
do guys know what they want whwen dating
if ya' need ya' 'es emoshunally, den ya' are goin' t'gotss' some troubles.
go with it if you feel comfortable and like it some.
don't forget, til death do you part.
just ask for her number, there's nothing wrong with that.
if girls think flowers die, then why do they want them so much?
to focus on her looks is shallow.
it shouldnt bother her if u ask. i mean u guys are dating
id do maui or the bahamas
its a problem to ask her out at work or not
he asked me out in a unique way
you certainly have set up a classic double standard.
i can't say what your wife thinks, but i hope i can give you a helpful viewpoint.
you should be mad and disappointed!
he got off the train when it got to his stop.
start at the top and then keep going a couple of decades.
fear not, little dudes, say no when the answer is no!
ignore what she's spewing, she's in pain right now.
if it doesn't work out you can kiss your job goodbye.
go clubbing and dance the night away!
i have passed great opportunitites involving others to many times
how do i get him to leave me be
when u r _num_-_num_, u says things u dont mean
why did he shave his legs
you should be super nice and make eye contact and smile :) !!
what do other ppl think?
question for guys: what size female do you like
she doesn't want you to just be into her for her lookcs
all i can say is... good luck!
i once said i luv u girl and meant it
get 'em if she says yeah
if you wanna be friends, u probably want _num_ more than friends
you gotta stop keeping secrets cuz its hurts the ones you love.
be real & have some balls cuz that's what woman want, but be real more.
why do ya care a/b what others say?
a dude that says that isn't being all that honest with himself, imho.
ditch him & go out with his bro!
death gives you cavities like,candy corn
eh i wouldnt want em too big
others like to follow the herd,but i like myself thick girls
that only makes her easier to lay(;
lol if you like him, call him!
coz u don't got any power
ur life, do what u gonna do
cougars like young men so they can feel betta!
i aint the typa chick that like romantic mealz at home
i'm just doing this so i can get more points.
thats just something you are going to have to risk.
don't let him keep you stuck at home because you want to work on your love life.
don't tell him too quick, no matter what.
it's so dumb to date someone that u work with.
if you both like going to the movies together, then do it.
it's right before fiveplay and just after threeplay.
get a sex toy that you could both have fun with.
ego ... its a guy thing lol
ur right udaman, gl!
i realy like him but i dont wanna push him away
i'm not thinking bout him, but i've been having dreams bout him.
probs not.. until he finds another gf.
you gotta get back in the game!
don't do anything you'll regret later!
chat on email and phone to keep internet dating safe.
yeah i did that and it was fun.
cheap ideas are everywhere. find which one works best for you.
you're probably done looking over the men that sees the world in you.
you'll find the right one.
you know it's real love if you can fart when you're around each other.
hope you get the chance to check it out sometime soon.
just walk up to her and say hey.
well i dunno your age (that would help!)
yeah, it is not healthy to do
there is no room for crazy monsters like him in society!!
do you mean seems more sexual?
this is question unfair?
that's like saying, "what can they say after the fact?"
you can save money by choosing certain dates.
i have no further comments on the issue.
why do guys have a hard time saying "love?"
if she loves you she should be fine with it
he asked if i can come with you
a lot of guys just want sex
its bc of a back spasm.
guys need to take r last names.
don't lose your friends bc of some stupid guy.
if he's into u, you'll just know
so glad they r up to the challenge.
put her favorite songs on cd.
i just want to be happy.
dont try to fuck
i feel embarassed when i fall in love
wait for u to be ready
u are too special for them
so, should i take it that he's into me?
i think a guy should take the first step in the dating game.
if i had my way, i would have kept my maiden name.
cut that negativity out of your life and don't look back.
try checking on how he's doing.
try new things to meet new peeps.
it's bs that my cousin likes her cuz i still got feelings.
it worked, i'm convinced.
do hugging, gifts, and fun for vday
not for any other thing but looks
they had no chance
i think they both are interested in me
itty bitty women is hwat they like.
remember to choose and vote for the best.
hubby and i have been together _num_ years and just got maried in december _num_
navy pier and a museums are cool to visit-theres a couple resttaurants and hotels,too.
on of them cwill cheat eventually
i dont think of my self like that. dont worry
my mom makes her trips with pat@alanatvl.com
its over six months. i cant move on
she should move to ma
it doesnt matter. i can handle this
some girls want gifts that last forever
she is strong and loving, but not happy
yuh are young if yuh are interested in sixth graders
size, shape, looks, and othuh surface features should not mattuh at all
yuh are askin' what deir stance is about gay relashunships, or what?
i agree, kiss him, and he will have a response fawh yuh
he gave me his cellphone so i could put my numbuh in it
if you want to have some fun here, i would suggest scoping out the clubs, restaurants, or gyms.
based on that, i would say that that they work it out, but not often, so hope i managed to help.
if you're ever down in fl, hit me up!
just go ask her if she wants to go on a date with you.
sorry, but idk. i still wish you the best.
hi i really want to visit your country
look for another sexy chick and she will become jealous
girl please don't even ask that question unless you want to get mad.
she knew i like him so i don't know now
he's always poppin his eys,why?
try _num_ to slow the roll
black hair makes fair skin gals look pale
at first i wasnt going to let her win.
do not tell her that she's fat.
wanna hear a terrible joke?

girls that drink turn me on
if thats what u want
its like getting over addiction
i should try that next time i start dating
but what do you want?
it sounds like you both like things just as they are now.
don't let yourself be dominated, she'll just have to get used to it.
if he doesn't don't be upset as you can always catch another fish.
no guy can give you what you want.
if you wanna keep being married, find yourself.
start from scratch, then go from there.
ask em if they wanna go somewhere with you.

i still haven't tried that but i'm working on it

it really sounds like you have a lot on your plate at this time.
i'm a guy, sou may want to ask another girl about those experiences.
i felt one way for a long time, but then my eyes really opened when i met the love of my life.
men are idiots, who knows why they do what they do.
your best friend is always a backup plan if you can't find someone else to marry.
i dont just want to pop out and be like will you go out with me?
lest you know him really well, you’re setting yourself up for hurt!
replace it - add it back like you did at first
if it’s your personal belief is not good or bad
those guys make you crazy bothering alllll day.
lol go to hawaii or pay a guy to do it lmao
boy/girl intelligence, how they be, pretty or ugly, laziness/active....playz a huge part in how i want them or not
i can throw em away n forget about it like yesterday’s garbage!!!
is it like that clear liquid thats yellow when it dries?
is weird when she drunk and sits on yo mans lap
it was before y’all were dating so that’s not cheating.
it always had to be his way....
determination is a self given gift.
gotta wait _num_ until you get hitched to a dude.
greetings and hugs to all my cone girlllzzzzzz!
just be yourself when you are together with her
idk what you are saying
the guy asked, do you mind if we cuddle?
why would some guys do that?
there are a few good girls out there, you have to look in the right places!
you gotta move on or work it out!
get yourself together, how can you love someone you don't want to talk to?!?!
find a pretty, talented girl!

maybe age is an issue
i'm not going to give you my nname but i've worked with this person for years
i don't understand the question... can someone plz anwer

if your really attracted to her just follow your emotions!
think hard about if you can afford it and if you can go ahead!
um i say get your old life back so you can survive!
dude, what are you saying?
don't be flirty... its not a turn-on
some women would probably say it's painful
just tell him what you actually want, that's what they said but never did...just say something
it'd be so much easier if i was pissed
just be done if they are
this is your punishment: _num_ no tv....
just say it, its not crazy because you’ve been to get her for so long!
that’s who she is, try it differently or keep your eyes on her.
doesn’t seem simple, tell me one more time slowly.
give em a chance to notice you!!!
unless its w/ wrong guy
my bf is obsessed w/ me and doesn't wanna lose me!!!
eh depends on whether they got brown hair
its just gotta play out after awhole
everyone wants to hear that they are sexy even if they won't admit it!!
i dance in downtown houston at clubs
i say good luck... but do ur homework!
i like natural more than a face with soooo much makeup on it
if you like him then you should def go for it!
who said women have no emotions
actions are louder than words
im thinking about a mdeium pink hue
see if he calls emails or even gives a crap

i might love him but i might just really like this dude
if he wont let up he just wants to bone you
if i try really hard, i can imagine an alternate reality.
i wanna have fun with you, that's why i answered this.
is that how you feel?
give him some cash and tell him to go.
imagine what it'd be liek without them
you gotta make it important that you see her if you want to carry on
i choose the domestic godess
are you deep in love with her?
men are always the first to get bored
get a good deal on flowers
what stuff do i need to visit the usa?
either fix it or leave, make sure your happy
not everyone is decent boyfriend material just because you think they could be
i bet she finds it ugly. blue will look better
do a citizens arrest on him
its not about the size of the pencil, its how your sign your name.
yes, this is great for all women
guys don't like secrets
well yeah, but it's up to the guy
people can't get why i'm hurrying
neither of em respect u
i totally can't talk to him even seeing him every week in psr
r u kidding, a dude who does that all da time is not for me!!!
give me a guy with nice smooth shaved legs anytime! ;o
so you really on the down low or just going for a test drive
oh yeah, id say they do that for sure
now thats a reall f/up that ya can't take back!!!!
i had my cherry popped in a park when i was _num_

dont be scared and tell him
im not gonna drive _num_ hours to spend time with someone i dont like
do they gossip on the phone
play sports with ur guy friends
u feel happy and giddy when u fall in love
i cant live with my husband
we always push away those we like
if u both still think that way when you're older, do it
tell her women wanna hear the truth, good luck
u have to decide if you want to be with someone you always argue with, forever
you're a man in the slightest sense
a and b cups are the best
if you're next to an ugly dude you'll look hot as a woman
younger is better for dating...i'd date someone at least _num_ years younger because who wants to be with old women??
yeah it's happened to me too and now i'm dating them
tell her wut you feel
you got naked baby pics
why do they want to marry
we did it on the hood in the rain
men don't need to grow up if women let em act like that.
do it a few times and you'll be cool.
while sex is like so fantastic!
i think hes pissed right now so he aint gonna be wit you.
fill me in if someone has the answer.
red is love, black your a goner and so on.
beefy peopel is what i like, feel ripped off with a skinny minni.
if your cluesless ask someone who would know.
when he tries to make up it will be fun
go with the one who likes you
ive been hard for her since freshman year
she was checkin you out, right?
i had no idea that life could be like this, so fantastic!
i admit it, i've got a serious crush on this guy, but i have no idea if he feels thesay way.
so, what's the best option for you and for him?
if nothing else, at least her phone number was the real deal.
it's all good, you aren't a slut!
they should get married if they can't control themselves.
she is on the phone with him all the time!
i don't see why, if you're already handing it.
i've seen you love a guy many times, but you just couldn't be sure if he felt the same.
is his mother a good enough reason to break up with him?
just be a nice dude and go for it, and if she doesn't really respond, then you know she's not feeling it.
my friends got hitched _num_ months after their first date!
be yourself and ask about their life.
show her what you can do.
this culture gets it right!
if ya'll don't ask you'll always wonder.
what u think? thanks
im saying dont worry so much... my _num_ cents
whats the worst that could happen????
i hate _num_ her _num_ be that way. confused!!!! do know what to do....
look for a person who doesnt hate you
no, most girls just hide it.
some guys don't wanna dance.
this generation is retarded
only one child? married?
well, could you trust him before?
ugly fat guys cant be picky
some poeple want to be a wife or husband
its not worth it if you only argue
enjoy asking that _num_ ur cellmate in jail!
do i like u?
even i am curious about sex with another woman.
she ain't gotta be younger _num_-_num_ is good.
the idea is simple, treat them right and with luv.
that happens, your decision will be easier.
be yourself and act nice and say nice things, chicks dig that
he cheated, which i think means i can lift or carry my husband.
make the best out of a bad set-up
u looking for dating or friends
id be good for valentines day
its very tempting :/
how long does it take for your relationship to get boring?
it just depends how fast you can get ready.
yeah i'd like to meet the girls.
it is what it is.
having online friends is cool as long as you set limits
do you want him to be your baby daddy?
he has low value if he turns you down girl
youll learn from experience, i promise
hope u married hubby coz of luv
its up to the chick. what she want?
i bet ima have someone waiting when i get home
u better go get that massage.lolz
ion know where _num_ start
all depends how ur body looks, you like what u see when u look in the mirror?
are you telling me that u referring to you avatar?
rub his feet real good after you walk around with him all day!
he'll call you if he cares about you.
you keep actin like this and she gonne think you r depressed and desperate!
there's a huge different between banging and making love.
i have four kids so being a mom is more exhausting than work.
just cuz you have a kid, doesn't mean you got to stay together man.
are you from the city or country?
you can always get married and have kids later, but you can't do school later.
ive never gone to it
do you wanna have a relationship with the same guy?
how often can you have sex with pam andersen??????
make sure she doesn't end up hating your when you make your point to her
my mom has cancer too. too close to home!
running my fingers through curly hair, <_num_ <_num_ <_num_ <_num_
i mean u _num_ both.
wait and the right gal will come, u will c...
i want my spouse to grow _num_
u need to make a move when there shy like that
the dr was just as surprised
u need to have fun with both, the sex is way better
do u need some practice kissing, i sure could come on over
its a yes, even if you don't agree
uh no offense but mayb its bc your name is 'freakgirl' but if u showed a pic of urself maybe not
well boys do that but men dont
just try and say do you wanna go out at some point
i had this happen to me two separate times!
dont date a guy just bc you think you have to
listen if u really wanted him that bad you would not be asking me!!
i am hoping that it does not ever happen!
ladies just want guys _num_ tell them how they really feel..,
u know how excited girls r when udoin it to them the right way
show her how much u want her !!
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss right on my forehead
yes im not _num_ of those people -- i know there's lots of them
its all about her, and it absolutely shouldn't be something that happens on a _num_ date!
ok it depends on how much you're starting to have feelings for this boy....
thank for the pep in advance
why do they want to be married?
i like gentle flirting with some romance
anyways, i married my hubby, and wonder if you know why?
lets to an amusement park or museum.
i like the guy, but how do i know if i'm in love?
which do you prefer, manicured nails or fake _num_?
don't worry about what other ppl want, plan what you want
we do all this stuff together now, i dunno what to do
i don't get u
i asked him if he likes me but he doesnt wanna do anything about it
i like your perfume
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue. girls like it
most guys dont care, but it depends on teh individual
it doesnt have to do with u being naive
dont get married so soon
you are bad if u cheat on ur wife
just do you. if he likes what he sees he will speak to you.
that person is the only one you want to be with.
he's about to get hitched....don't even go there!
did you let her know how annoying checking in with you every single day is?
new neighbor asked me to chill
teenage boys and girls like masterbating
he is good at bbal
are you someone who likes to fight?
if he wantet you instead of her he probably would have left her for you.
the most important issue is not trying to retaliate against the one who did you wrong.
one man who will go hours and miles to be with me.
omg, have you been to a doc yet?!
maybe she wasn't a biatch but the skinny girl was def!!
get a life and stop wasting my time!!!
its like the same thing as binging on chocolete then cryin about being fat
i went there and he was there
oh yeah if he's not taken then grab him
oh yeah if you dont do what they say you're gonna get a beating
well do you like him or not?
tell your mom and dad if you havnt already
most will tell you no
u think he feels the same way about u?
some guys only say love if they mean it...
he def likes u, show him how u feel!!
i think everyone should keep their own name.
guys enter and exit, but friends are forever
believe that it was considered love
you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.
some guys like chicks of that type and others, not so much
be a sham if u want kids
young dudes or old women, watch think?
he wants to keep the shit up
you better not cheat on your hubby, ya'll made vows, ijs
there is no alternative to just being "love."
your self-image is super important
i am a girl and i say that stuf...
girls can be just as perverted... trust me!!!!
flowers are nice but dont last long
i havent seen some movies
she is sweet. u should have her
use your brain not ur dick. maybe she doesnt like u
pleez dont take this the wrong way but that sounds like a girls name.
never call him back is not worth the problems.
not interisted in any ladies on my app list so i picked my neighbors sweet lady.
marraige is all trust and talking things out between each other
whatever they say to do , do not listen!
what can i do to snag her?
give her a _num_ and tell her you llove her.
it's not the norm, but it's not a bad thing either.
try working things out so you both end up happy
those girls could be enough for a man but their not up to our level
you got it, especially when she got sick.
because...as you prolly know...try to find your love...but keep a lookout!
i need more info _num_ i can help u more.
there's no wrong or right way _num_ kiss.
you should take ur time in deciding...
having some fun w/ ur guy friends is fine
just think about what you like to do and do the same... maybe a tongue massage!!
my so was my friend first which makes our relationship awesome!
i'd say its more of a trust issue...
i need help with this i'm screwed
if he dont like you then move right along
he doesnt want to know
if you can then make it yrself
is there anything else you do besides work and fix things?
i told her straight-up that i loved her
the senior guys think the freshman chicks are all easy, sad
how do i give him a kiss
look in the deleted items, that's where it should be
good luck finding that nice girl
that's a horrible idea, think of why you are there
that list could go on forever
be happy with anyone even if it's a man, just like brokeback mountain
don't base your whole relationship on sex
i've gotta tell her sooner than later, because she is my bestie, but any help you can give me would be awesome.
it's super bad luck if you sneak a peek at the bride on the wedding day.
stay strong out there, and i wish you the best!
it's just some lil get together for the fam.
if you're not really feeling the performance aspect, then skip it.
i just tied the knot
depends on how you were raised, how old you are, etc
no rush, you just gotta pick a last name when you have kids
don't you think your kid's gonna have a rough time being raised without their daddy?
bald men look like babies to me, it's just not cute
try it. break up. itll be harder to be friends in the future
what was the score of the last game
get rid of ur ex cause u have a better man
fly or drive to vegas to get married
yes! i want to know u way better.
c or d is just what i like. doesn't need _num_ be bigger than taht.
never admit the truth just change the lies!
they never played live before so it is twice as good.
momma won't let me wear those clothes.
we haven't seen you!
cause opposites attract and you'll always find some one
i def think that this is better than my life!
dont go to the same places that you went with your ex.
talk to your bestie and lemme know if it's cool
it sounds weird, but it def worked for me in _num_-_num_ days
i dont like when he messes with you
no im not married
some men do like big girls, most tend to be african american.
i write women poetry, am i the only one?
i told her i liked her, but she doesn't want to risk our friendship.
overlook his faults and stay with him if you care.
do they make fun of you when with him?
they are the best cause i'm a guy and i aint got to have _num_ ask anyone to the event.
if your against it that much- then do'nt get married.
it depends on if their vain or not.
get over it and get someone who actually likes you.
get to know her so you can ask her out soon.
i think he was blowing me off, so i asked.
i think some young guys like asian girls.
make your own decision.
just let him know you want something low key.
i don't know why you aren't happy, since he's doing his best for you.
this is just plain bad, stuffed with lots of smaller bad things.
they've been pretty good years, but not the easiest
weve seen each other everyday for four or five years!!
pretend i'm the guy you want and date me!
hey a little flirting never hurt anyone!
you should go with your gut!
why haven't i kissed a girl after eight months with her?
they look better than lots of other nations.
the day after is alright by me.
see if she can go for movie and dinner
men get to the point. women dont
ask in english i dont get it
sorry, but i dont know...
remember, a bird has never flown with one wing
i often worry about this
youll never find a girlfriend if you are so needy
i met a girl recently, i want to know if i have a chance.
dont sit and wait for a call
be what and whot you want to be
lots of young girls date older guys. now the younger guys are insecure and search for even younger girls
if he gets it thru his head cool. if not move on
if he really loves u he'd disapoint his dad.
don't say sorry to him if u did nothing wrong...dont be weak!!
better do it before its too late
this girl does not want a shitty man.
i like hearing black woman talk baout this
hel pme argue with her
most of the men are similar to ur age
ugh, when will ppl figure this out?!
i dunno what i should do now
you go to a bar and get wasted!
i acted like that in front of my boyfriend.
if you gotta ask, it is a no.
don't just sit there and wait till he sees you for what you are.
im getting a divorce and i'm stuck with this!!
you'll be okay, just have a good time!
um your bf will think your being a jerk...
you can't fix the relationship w/ her parents but maybe ask her about helping with the relationship with her friends?
imo, i wouldn't marry a woman who wouldn't take my last name.
maybe give girls a try, since guys can be so off-putting.
i was with my ex for about _num_ years before they were unfaithful.
just see what the next _num_ months has in store, and you'll find out.
there is one in particular i was fond of, and it goes a little something like this.
not all guy break up with their girls
theres a lot of fun stuff there
is it alright to kiss on the first date
i have a girl friend
they wanna fuck each other
when he does tell him you messed up and you actually want to be with him and didnt want to break up
my friend thinks im too nice and should say no to them
but (there's always a but)
some guys do, not all of them, though
if you do that you can keep your last name
go up say hey and ask if she's dtf
yo that was mad hot but kinda scared me off
fat girls can be hot
not everyone here is taking classes
practice taking the wrapper off of starbursts & tyeing cherry stems....with your tongue
if u keep talking _num_ him for another week, hes gonna this ur married!!! lol!
if u vote for me for best answer, i'll pay!
go to a public place. you'll be more comfortable.
work with him and pay attention to how he reacts.
and inviting someone takes the pressure off me.
please say you'll date me.
she remembers my messes.
how can i let her know that i'm not just one more guy who'll hit on her and run?
i'm a guy so let me enlighten you.
it's gonna be ok, you're _num_
don't go trail riding by your damn self.
if you two love each other, it'll be good!!!!
gotta make eye contact.
yep i can lift him.
he's gotta start again and gain ur trust.
my ex and me have history. second grade then fourth then again in _num_
u wanna ask who out?
i'm hoping you read this really carefully
play truth or dare together!
wait till you find out and confirm, then go from there
um that is stupid bc you need a theory class for that!!!
just stop if you eat antying like that
can't stop thinking about sex with her
the only way to find out is to ask him face to face
woot jamie is asknig rubi out on a date !!
its carrying on because neither of you have the balls to end it
they seem to like learning about that
oh snap - he straight up just scored _num_ points
do guys like fatter girls
he loves you too, but you gotta wait to know
if a guy respects u, he'll understand u.
we started this.....our own sins.
the dudes answer works for me.
youll be able to love him still, but get over it`
smart chicks are hot
its not right they cant go out with her
my sis closes her eyes when she goes to kiss someone
i met my last bf in a roundabout
yeah hes getting hitched later this month
idk whether to let go and move on, what do you think?
do you ever replay what u did to me?
it wounds like you two got hitched already.
first why didn't the relationship end?
he may call if you leave him alone.
you should let more know.
take it a day at a time, like step by step. think on how he let a good thang get away.
um, heya harold, dinner still on?
if ya gotta ask, then no!
go on and go to school, you can come home anytime or hit up your friends and fam.
i never wanna have sex w anyone ever again!!
let him approach u first, you will look crazy if you go to him first!
some people just dont do it bc of religious beliefs.
guess you ok with yourself.
it's your choice if you feel comfortable with them.
thinking to much is not going to provide assistance if he is truthorthy.
are woman sexually attractive and beautiful are they?
see if she's going to hit you!!
you're trying too hard dude!! be yourself!
see what he's willing to do for you
but that doesn't mean that u cant love each other
how would they know you if you don't tell em anythin
it dont matter what they think
what wulaitities do u want in a girl
women like thoughtful men
stay cool, acting hard to get might help
look how she walking!
why would he care if ur at the dance together
girls love men who are confident.
after class ask her to go out with u
u need help. see a therapist.
i'm still in love with him for some reasons.
that works for me. i like to give when i get a little something in return.
go get something that can't ditch. whatever!
you've only met creeps with weird fetishes
i'm not telling u to not get some tail till then(;
dont make him dance if he doesnt wanna
i'm a dude, but i'll tell you what i know
my bae won't give me luv in person
no idea if she meanz it

hubby n i luv my dope blk hair
people choose stuff so quickly
they are trying to be something they're not.
i was already married to a jerk, so no!

i want a girl who wants to be around me.
it was the best thin _num_ me
i had a fling with a dude one time who i met in a rainstorm
u gonna get paid if u work for me
is shit eva gonna be the same?
you better choose one and know why yo
im happy with brown hair
get aposrt or vehicle stuff for ur gift to ur husband
that isn't what you can be
the prob is that he did the worst thing possible he cheated on me recently!
use your imagination... and imagine you and him together at night!
it really hurt and i started to bleed!
honestly, it could mean a lot of different things...
let's do lunch...in _num_ years.
eye contact's good but give 'em a grin!
no friend you want to take a break from, ever?
he's on my s**t list for doing that.
i know what i want and who i want it with
it happened right there in the middle of the river, i fell over laughing
if you are hot, show your tits to him
so its natural for him
i got excited when i saw a malysia air commercial
go out and do all sorts of stuff you couldnt when you werent single
its extremely possible to enjoy giving more than receiving
am i crazy for not moving on after _num_?
go back to foreplay if you feel it start coming on.
most guys will be into you regardless...usually.
thailand is full of woman strolling along, just ask one!
u gotta last at least _num_-_num_ min.
trouble is i dig him a lot.
it's buy on get one man.
pakistan is so conservative, i did not know.
we can wrestle and be best friends.
i basically only see him around my brother's basketball games.
that was pointless. where do you all live?
you gotta let her know what you like about her.
it's just a phrase that means they aren't into you.
nothing lasts forever, and everyone grows apart.
i was working there for a bit when i met my lover.
i'll go and check one out
don't wait, jump on it
girl, more dudes in the world like fat chicks than you think
i was pretty casual when i said it, i really didn't think he'd remember i said that!
chicks don't like a dude that's selfish and only gives a crap about himself
look right at it.
a cd or dvd is good probably.
you both toil hard to be sure it is done well.
she'll call if she is interested.
i care about you alot and you are always on my mind.
would you reccomend giving him a second chance down the road a ways?
if you think your relationship is suffering, work on it.
daniels hasn’t read one of them “manga books”.
use this if they actually apply.
i went through the same kind of thing too.
maybe she just wants to play the field?
think about which one you like the best, and pick them.
be ready if she's out of here.
i dumped all my issues on him and maybe i shouldn't of.
idk, i'd just get over it.
you'd get over it if you lose him.
sometimes u gotta check your beau...
get the snacks if he bought the tix
you both on the bounce so it's cool.....
my girl is intense, thats why i luv her so!
you will met that good dude one day!
be strong, you'll be great.
what about green and blue?
some guys do, some don't.
i want a kind, smart female.
it could have been worse - at least it not bella!
its more like _num_-_num_ not _num_
what good did that do?!
what she wants really who knows.
my bff cant stand my guy and lives for the day we break up, but i know well stay together forever.
we just saw each ohter than one time.
you sent out over _num_!!!!
my freinds dont let it go further than kissing
ladies use there brain
act like a gentleman and ask her questions about herself
how long does it have to be bfore you figure out that it's taking too much times and she's just not that into you?
girls don't like smoking. they know that guys who do it are committing suicide.
i can only be myself when i'm with guys i'm not into, and we all know how that works out.
the timing with the old guy wasn't right - you'll see!!!
take them both out of a date!!!
i'm my only sis's maid of honor i want it to be perfect!!!
i hate sleeping cause my bf snores
if they dont get along they should be friends why do u care what they think
dont tell her u want to be with her forever even if u do
tell her to call for immportant stuff only
i gotta stop cause i gotta pee
youd b the furthest thing on my mind after _num_ days.
did ya feel the need to say that!???
i'm agree wit the other guy befoer anyone gets hurt.
peeps arent yo-yo's so dont toy with with.
ooh, i'll have what she's having.
just be loving and sweet, and that will earn big points with her.
guys have a bone, and ladies have a bean.
after being together for so long, and going through so much, you can't help but love your wife.
hm, i don't need a high maintenance girl - i want a companion!
ugh, i hate it but i like the straight variety.
if she like him then there has to be a motivation...
you can't trust anyone more than you trust a good friend!
i mean thats weird but idk what do i know, ill see what my friend thinks by the lockers later
if you look ok then he wont really care how big your boobs are
i mean i'm a guy i feel things you know
call the q&a team they'll help you. have a good day
i go for smart, fun and good looking girls
that's great, that girl gave me a perfect answer
if they want they type of pic it's sex
so exactly where do you find all these filipino women?
you could ask him to grab some food or see a movie, something like that.
no i like dudes who are regular looking.
someone was being a punk to me because i was still dating.
i love him but i'm over it.
if you ask her for permission she's gonna lose it.
men are so full of themselves thinking they're all that and can pick and choose women.
i want sex occasionally
i have heard it alot
you're the dom in that relationship for sure
one that appreciates you'll come along, just wait
stay away from there, i don't trust it
it depends on how it looks
let him go and move on. if it is meant to be he iwll come back
the guy i like is mad at me
do you like asian food like chinese or japanese?
my cousin met this bizarre old weirdo online that had convinced her he was a dirty teen.
if you really want to know, no, i'm not in love.
actions speak louder than words, so watch out for that.
always be yourself, and never let a guy tell you how to be.
still love'em, but dont know what to do
just talk to your wife about it
give'em the doughy eyes and that'll be enough
you could stop beating around the bush and tell her like it is
if you ask that, it's totally gonna kill the mood, so i suggest just having fun together.
and then there's making out and asking how if they enjoyed it.
jules sac cracks me up, but he's kind of a jerk.
have you seen my boyfriend around lately?
if a dude is stuck on himself, it's not hot.
i can tell cause i'm just like ur wife
you ain ready if u gotta ask the folks
get all tarzan-like with the shit and rip your shirt off!
nove on and get a new man if u don't love hubby no more
be honest and say nice stuff
i like a _num_ grade boy too
they feel insecure around stupid guys
we can go on a date and see if we like each other
i'll be expelled if she tell the administration bc its pakistan, not the us
my friend is in an online relationship
i love cuddling with a biggggg woman
i'm pretty sure the bomb is a lot easier!
his dad comes from his part of the family tree, and i've met him before.
anything thats easy to pick up
be her friend first then her boyfriend
she cheated on me for _num_ years
hit him cause he likes someone else
do not let dem know in advance but radder allow dem tuh discovuh once yuh are in bed togethuh
it is not so impawhtant here in america
be confident and always believe in yawhself. yuh got me so fahr? do not become arrogant, though. okay? always make good eye-contact and listen tuh what she has tuh say
let it take its cawhse
i know becawze i dates someone like dat
yeah i totally shoudlve listened to my friends
just leave him if he's being a dick
you should just do what makes you happy and ignore _num_ else :)
we sort of tried to move on but it was useless
if you don’t pop the question someone else will beat you to it.
this twin of mine won’t talk or listen to me....
she’s gonna answer you because she’s polite.
you didn’t marry him for nothing.
ask if he will go to movies with u
some girls can find atractive guys their age
it dont matter. were just friends
in that situation, take a self defense class
thats what i see
wow she is sooooo drunk!
u gotta take time to get to know them both w/out dating them
do you get that he loves you?!
u can join a community with webcam and live chat
i tell ya - those were good times!!!
if your promiscuous then so is he!
i guess they lgot preferences idk
would be cray if she called _num_ a day
u might be his one and only luv
tell that idiot to gtfoh
omg how old are you now?
they want to run other peoples lives but its not working
if thats true and u really like him, let him go.
someone i can just be me with
the rest is so easy from here
if u tell them you love them and u have to wait for them to say it back, you'll know everything.
i just got out of a _num_ yr relationship with my baby daddy
i wish you all the best in finding the one!
i know it's been awhile, but i still haven't fallen out of love with him.
i know he knows how you feel about him, but has he responded?
everyone has their own tastes and types when it comes to attractive.
my wife has the patience of a saint, and forgives me a lot.
if you tell you him you wanna get with him casually, what will happen?
i am totally into him and he says he would get with me if i was single.
women are more bad than men are!
she is using you, man!
stop doing things that will hurt you.
you'd be surprised if u knew what kinds of ppl like him
hold off til you're _num_, you wont lose your appeal by then
so that's how u do it if you really set on it
do guys even know what they want in a relationship?!
stay away from your ex, its not good.
go with it if it is something you like.
you have to remember you are in this forever!
who cares if she asks for your number?
why do so many girls say flowers won't last if it is yes?
don't look at the way she looks first!
the question shouldn't bother her at all if you guys are seriously into each other
if i was gonna go, i'd say do the bahamas... or maybe maui
asking her out at work or not, that's ur problem
the way he asked me out, girl, you wouldn't believe how nice that was
you've really made a double standard there.
i'm not a wife and can't say from that experience but maybe mine is as good
you're right to feel let down and mad.
then he got to his stop and got off the train.
you've gotta start at the beginning and look down the road _num_ years
you should never be scared to just say no.
seriously, let it go, regardless of what he says, because she's hurting enough already.
well, there's the fact that if it doesn't pan out the way you wanted, your job is gone.
how about getting your dance on at the club?
i missed many a opportunity focusing on others instead of myself
what do i have to do to stop these trolls
when you're a young adult you say stuff you dont mean
in gods name why would he shave his legs
smile make eye contact and ... be nice!!!!
well what do you guys think
hey guys ... when it comes to girls do you like em big or small?
she doesnt want it to just be about her looks though
wooohoo good luck then :d
i told a girl once i loved her
if she says yes, pick her up
if you want her as a friend, you want something deeper
keeping secrets hurts your loved ones
be real and manly. most women like that, but especially if you're real.
forget what the others are saying.
any man who said he would is prob lying to himself
forget his ass, get with his brother instead.
death is basically a box of candy corn - it gives you cavities hahahah!
um yeah i wouldn't want a pair that big!
others like to do as society says but i think we should rebel and love thick girls!
that just makes having sex with her easier!
if youre that attracted to him, you should call him
its cause you don't have any say in the decision
hey, its your life make your own decisions!
i say get younger and younger guys as you get older to make yourself feel better!
btw i'm not the kinda girl who likes a romantic dinner at home.
imma do this jus so i cn get points
dat's a risk u gon hav _num_ take
work on your relationship but don't be nobody's prisoner
no matter what u do, don't be tellin him _num_ soon!
don't shit where you eat
if you and your significant other love the movies, then go together.
you know, foreplay, right between threeplay and fiveplay.
you should buy a sexy adult toy that will make you both happy.
every man has an ego you just have to deal with it :(
yeah i agree w/ udaman
i like him alot but i don't want him to reject me :(
i only think of him in my dreams.
prolly not till he finds a new girl
have fun, see new people
don't do anything you'll regret later.
to be safe when dating online, only talk by email or phone
ya, i did it and it was a ton of fun
there's lots of cheap ideas, find out what you want to do and go from there
you might be over looking for men who give u respect
you'll find your one, mrs. right someday
if u can fart in front of someone your in love
i cant wait to see it
walk up and talk bro
tell me how old you r cuz it'll help.
i think so too, its nasty to act like that
banish the psycho monsters from public, theres not enough room _num_ _num_
you mean it's provoking what?
r u f**kin with me kid?
it's almost like saying, what can stop me after i have already done it?
you can save tons of money if you pick the right day.
i'm not going to say anymore.
why dont men evr say love?
if she luvs u, ur gf should chill with her shade
he said to come wit u
just thinkin with the other head
its from a back spasm.
maybe they should take our last names instead.
your gunna have no friends left bc you keep choosing a guy!
youll feel it if he really likes u!!!
i love that they ar eup for a challenge
drop a tape for her.
i wanna be happy
don't try to have sex
occasionly, when in a romance with someone, i feel embarrassment
when you ready, it be worth it.
you too good for those people.
um, does that mean he likes me
the guy should def take the first step!
if it was up to me, i would of just kept my last name
you need to just separate the bad stuff and move on man!
go find out how he is.
i'm heading out to hook up with peoples.
i'm so pissed at my cousin cause he knows i still feel her.
damn, you were right!
enjoy v day with fun and gifts and happiness!
its only for appearances...
oh yeah, they never had a prayer!
i think they both like me tho...

navy piers got good food, hotels museums and places to eat
they always cheat on each other.
no worries even i don’t have many choices.
momma books em at pat@alanatvl.com
_num_ later and i still can’t forget about it.....
she felt that it was necessary to move to the bay state.
i don't care, honestly, just a little bit works for me.
some women prefer gifts that won't wither like flowers.
despite being a strong female who loved deeply, she wasn't really happy inside.
means you're pretty young if sixth graders are your thing.
what u look like on the outside shouldnt matter at all!
you mean what they think about lgbt relationships?
yeah just kiss him, that will give you your answer.
got his phone, put in my number.
if you wanna have a good time, check out a restaurant or nightclub or gym.
so i'd say that they do succeed, but not very often - hope this helps...
look me up if you are in florida!
hey, just ask her on a date!!!
sorry i dont know, good luck to you both!
i wanna visit your country.
get another sexy chick, so she can hate.
don't ask if you don't wanna be salty.
she knows i care _num_ him so i dunno what to do
so last item, he always stare like that?
_num_ slows down the pace. try it
white skinned ppl look paler with black hair
no way was i gonna let her be first!
you don't call a woman a fatass!
wanna hear a dirty joke?
if you didn't play the guilt trip you know it would be.
it seems he is having too much fun while you're gone.
yes, i'm sure anyone would.
some couples will never be that easy with one another.
it's obvious men aren't much better.
second date with him nevvvvver happened.
its cause your the prettiest thing they ever saw.
luckily you have found the love of your life...you should be with them.
if he is worthy you wont need to do a god damn thing!
whoah did you seriously just start talkin about kissing when you are so young??
order one online and then… bam... a magical stork brings one right to ya!
it gets harder as you go!
just keep doing you. don't worry, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.
just smile thru it
quit talking with that bum and get him off your mind!
girls whinnin bout flowers should be happy they got em
lol why i don't date

i dont like girls
stop seeing your cousin and ex
ive never given a girl a xmas gift unless i like her
who can tell is country girls are hot
you know i met mine at a carnivle
my husband loves me for who i am
no way, she's not a liar
if they don't do it, you need to just move on girl
pick which flowers and arrangement you like.
if he doesn't care who else matters?
you can do better than him.
she lets me watch cartoons and watch cartoons
lime green is good for summer weddings
what can i do
the right relationship will happen on its own time
if you're fixated on looks, you're trying way to hard to prove yourself.
i want your brutal honesty, i can take it.
how about going to grab some breakfast, and follow that up with a pleasant morning walk.
i did this by mistake. my friend blocked me
be nice when u tell ehr
you guys should kiss when you are ready!
ask her actual questions... don't just say random things
i think youre a good guy and she probs loves you a lot!
text her back if she calls you
nooooo! not acceptable! your just ruining your health bc girls don't like it!
find that specifal someone you like and ask them to be ur valentine!
tell her that you miss her and love her
if nothing will work, ask him again.
some do have it and some don't.
he won't tell you know if you ask.
george clooney looks nice in this picture.
my partner wants me to look different
those replies are cocky, i’m way hotter
gross teeth, halitosis, and bo
nothing that’s said can make this better.
if men just knew how to make women happy the world would be better
so, you want to blow another dude?
i'd rather you not get hitched.
as a guy i find that payment is not necessary.
if he wants to put these pants on, he needs to say the word.
and so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
good luck in your search for the one!
why does everyone seem to want someone that they can't have and know that they shouldn't want.
do you like to argue and fight???
so if you're set on that, that's the way to go!!
my ex of _num_ years cheated.
work at it but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
>>other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
also men get bored and tire way before woman do.
she's strong and loving and most of all...really wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
its one way of saying i don't like you!
king had a song about this - only your mother loves you (and see might be jiving too).
he loves you, too, girl...time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone to come home to.
did you fell goog because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful
you want all your friends forever?)
it doesn't mean that you are slutty.
going to a club and dancing.
don't go anywhere you went with him or her.
they're a lot of fun - there's plenty to do.
it all depends on when ur ready.
stay _num_ miles away from this guy.
just be prepared cause if it happen once it can happen again!
i'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
least not till he gets another girlfriend.
wife says, we don't wear that shit.
if you're asking, then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options.
why do gays want to get married?
(saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self...and don't ever get weak!!)
do you have to rush your choice?
they both dont respect your feeling.
no seriously, think about howmany cocky girls are out there.
she is too afraid to ask him out.
get a grip, how can you love someone that you don't even communicate with.
i'd ask you out, but i live in oregon and have no idea where you live...
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure!
i'll probably go and see one.
either way, best of luck but i'm just glad that i have brown hair!!
mail me a pick honorarius@yahoo.com and i will tell you...
it is absolutely just a challenge!!!!!!!!!!!
well-im girl so ill help u out.

if i would've kept my last name its just a freakin name.
i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
he's telling that to some gurls too... he's a womanizer..
drop his buttt, there are plenty of fish in the sea of amore:_num_)
i know because i am just like your wife.
when she calls, text her back
no way im _num_`_num_ and he`s _num_`_num_
dont you know the number one rule, trust no one.
we've tried breakin up a couple times but it never happens.
oh and some because theyre thin and skinny and nowadays anorexic girls are a turn on.
if u have penis than its no problem u just hv to penitrate her pussy with ur errect penis.
in that case tkake some defense classes.

hey, i'm in nyc i'll help you out if your around!
sounds strange but it worked in about _num_-_num_ days for me!
don't worry, i aint working with much either.
why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather.
if he is then you have a good man.
if he likes you, you'll know!
i guess its normal, but id just move on
the rest is easy from there!!
i like any guy that is funny.
girl only you can decide on this...
why do you ask this question??????????????
do go telling everyone just because you think thats right.
_num_ years gap is just nice.
then if he still doesn't like you, then move on.
ok i see him ever week in psr but i just cant talk to him!!!
beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys..........
for one thing if it doesn't work out there goes your job.
and i hope to god it doesn't ever pass!
only the ones that aren't worth your time
smaller of course, and it is all about looks!!
you guys don't have any reason to hate each other.
if you don't you'll always wonder.
some people choose not to because of thier religion, others don't.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
the best of luck to ya!
men who were not ready to committ.
this is a big day in both of your lives, it shouldnt be done quickly and without thought.
i'm _num_ years old and still live at home with my mammy,whats wrong with that!!!!

well depend on women wot she want
remember it takes two not one
if he really didn't like her and did like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
hang around untill the bar closes -- or visit a prison
please dont miss out on this one !!
because believe it or not, women hate cocky men.
but stick with wats inside of u.
hell, it happened to me twice.
maybe your young, i don't know.
no matter what he says, action speaks louder then words
aint nothing in the world like a big boned gurl!
( even if he is rich, dont sell ur self.
just moved to sacramento, gay male, _num_
the people who are around you now, like your friends, should like you no matter what!
cuz they like the little titis and pussys
wait til you get older and if you both still feel the same way then go for it!
yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
no, not if you have to ask...
and you want to suck another man's d**k???
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are !
'...does this mean he likes me?.

hello: i am looking to visit your country.
overtime should i give him another chance?
the same guy you wanna be in a relationship with?
i went and there he was.
(that's what i called it).. but , why?
that way you can still go by your last name!
both of u work hard to get it right!!
i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship.
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat

one girl michelle, who probably wouldn't mind being named, spoke up and said she didn't believe in it.
i can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash........lol
but he was a lil busy after that.
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him.
if you do eat something like that then just quit.
it could be that u need to piss or the last dream u had
you know.......if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.......sheesh!
if you were friends before and have stronger feelings now then it should be o>k>
and i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
lie lie lie and then lie some more
wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there!
if you two are at a dance, he shouldn't really care.
trust him, don't bring it up again.
honestly, most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels.
hell ya i would love to meet the ladys!!
i actually ponder this one now and again.
i met this guy once, very romantic, i met him in this huge rainstorm.
ok now some guy's like girls like that and some don't
it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay.
when i fall in love, i feel stupid.
if you have to ask, then you are not in love.
if you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again.
i don't understand someone please give me the answer
i saved a good _num_-_num_ doing my own flowers and it was no hassle at all.
i just got a divorce and so do did he.
but ask a girl about the sympthoms because i'm a boy.
be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
follow ur heart... it's neva wrong
they bother u all day long.
see if he calls, e-mails or even cares.
you can do a civilian arrest _num_
a spasm in your back usually
by now, you might love your wife for everything you guys have endured.
good luck and i hope everything goes well!
say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
try asking her out again and see what she says.
;) there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
ask her questions (don't just talk).
when you first fall in love, your gitty, goofy, and silly happy just thinking about that person.
and remember there is more then _num_!
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there.
we got married all over again!
all in all i don't think it really matters.
and im sure as heck not driving _num_ hrs just to hang out unless i really really like her.
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it.
think about what good it brought about.
the thing is im a person that does not like to brake others heart.
give a rose and express ur love
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one!
remember, till death do you part!!
bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
what the hell r ya talking abt?
if you keep talking to him for another week,he might think he is married to you.
women dont want much, just some acknowldgement and sometimes help.
at least thats what it seems like to me.
don't be afraid to say no.
dump him...there are always more fish in the sea.
to me it realy dose'nt matter, but a hand full is quite enought for me.
choose the one that adores you the most!
you still released at least a thousand!
you go to a bar and get drunk!
give it some time and thought.
no u shouldnt leave them...just teach them what to do to please u better...
bembie hit the nail on the head
no.u guys kiss when ur ready
haha julesac is funny, but mean.
if youre asking this, u surely have already distanced yourself from her and yet remaining a friend.
dont forget to choose and vote for best answer!!!
dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is.
i dont know.but i know of another website that i go to..
ok it depends on how much your starting to have feelings for this boy!
!he must be a control freak
it all depends on the girl or the and how intersted the girl is in the guy.
look, try and get out to meet people.
usually it is multiple things not just one thing
if u really really really really really really like them
for the guys: (a) do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
if all you do is argue it's not worth it..
what makes it worse is that i already went out with him for four years!!!!
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
unless you dont love your husband anymore and you have room for another man????
wife because then you can do more with out comminting a sin
she definitely wants you to think she's good looking, but she doesn't want that to be reason #_num_
depends, some days i want to have sex, somedays i don't.
plus they are more passionate in love makin.
if you play w/both at the same time, she will probably f-*# the sh%$ out of you!
because he wouldn't work, hit me, used guilt trips, was a big mama's boy, etc.
maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen.
it really depends if someone is vain or not.
someone i can be myself with.
send me your picture and contact me ..
stay away from this guy friend.
the doctor can't even believe it.
yes for sure, especially when she throw up!!
if not, then don't sweat it!
i could give you some pointers.
if you feel your love is fading, don't just sit there and do nothing!
i will not stay with someone i don't trust.
i only once told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
you married him and it was for a reason.
rip off your shirt and do a tarzan yell.
yes, girl down there, don't have sex.
they accept this in thier culture.
always trail ride with a friend.
you didn't give us very good information/ do you all live in one house.
move on - so what if he's hot...looks aren't everything.
lol most important... just be yourself.
yes be disappointed and be mad!!
sorry, i never have felt that way!
i sure wont like any girl who would make my life difficult...
or if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
practice, ask if your doing good.
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready.
well i met mine in a carnival.
sounds like a rhetorical question :)
well i believe everybody should keep their own name.
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan.
there is nothing but trouble there!
how to make a woman happy to make a woman happy....?
dont do things tht can get you hurt.
i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard.
please don't go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
i don't think it's good idea, u are not there for this purpose!
go up to her and say 'hi, are you single?'
i think he would make a great valentine.
just be prepared to let her go.
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one.
just tell them, what are they gonna do, slap you??
get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him.
take them both out at the same time
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
only two points to make friends _num_
so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
preferrably someone who doesn't hate you.
we tried to move on but it didn't work.
when will people in this effed up world finally realize this?!?!?!?!?!?!
i wouldn't bother calling him back.
try not to hang out with him and find another guy.
look for another hot girl, so she will be jealous.
so in my opinon ur not a hoe!
red= love, black = death ect...
if she likes him than she dont like u dump her is not his fault that she strays
for me anything after _num_ days and i might start to forget about you.
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
there no one you can trust more than a good friend !
start the day off with breakfast out...then perhaps a nice walk.
then go pick them up (if she say yes).
if yes, why do i heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last?
may be its interesting for them
could it ever be the same...
it's not that bad... at least it is not bella
could it be because some men are liars and fat mouths??
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances...
finally a culture that has it right.
my twin wont talk or listen to me
want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
only i am not thinking about him but i am having dreams about him.
if ur talkin ten then i think it would be fine to get a video/ computer game.
go for it and take the chance!!!
if he can't then take him to a place where they have slowdances (dinner date, maybe?)
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life.
it's your choice not to hate one, i dislike them to say the least.
never ever get married without a prenup....
get a life and don't waste mine.
she says your too good for her?
guys come & go, but friends are forever!
it could probably mean a lot of things.
yes it is normal cause their is lots of people who still likes some they broke up with.
i`d like to see what a black female has to say about this.
guys are stupid!who knows why they do what they do.
well if they gave you their phone number you dont have to wait at all
cause were masters of the universe...
i'm in love and don't care who knows it buddy the elf.
and whatever you do, don't try to have both of them at once.
if you really wanted to be with him, you wouldn't be asking.
remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits.
when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready.
now me, i wouldn't marry any women who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
umm small party for the family
girls are perverts they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly
and im only in fith grade o ya!
but you do what you want.
don't do that, it won't work.
if they don't, it's time to move on.
he everything i ever wanted with the looks, money, stuff.
yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
nope, she is not a liar.
shut the hell up and be gay if you want to!!!
and he had his nose pierced.
yup, i can lift him, he's only _num_
you need a therapist for that.
maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
you should go see a shrink!
giving you stupid excuses of the wall!acting the way he didn't before!
be strong, and hang in there.
nope, he's too darned big and i'm too darned weak!
basically if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob / or slut then yes it is unattractive...
exchange letters, e-mails, chat online, talk over the phone, send packages... just keep in touch!
especially if you don't feel like it.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... _num_ points...
giving it up just for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
i cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good.
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone...
depends on the woman, it's better shaved=-)
ask in english terms...cannot understand you
hey, i'm a guy, but i'll tell you a little.
i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away.
ok like i really really really like this guy and i dont know if he likes me back.
btw - ur avatar looks familiar.
it's been over _num_ months & i can't seem to get over it.
maybe he thinks he will be turned down.just ask...i would.
you gotta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him!
a picture the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated....thats special
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out.
listen it aint that easy.i got with my ex-boyfriend in _num_ grade,then again in _num_,and again in _num_
i've been with this girl for _num_ months and we haven't kissed is this bad?
some guys don't like boobs at all!
or that she just wants to see other people?
and hes seen me every day for about _num_ or _num_ years!
there was his stop so he got off the train.
i mean the worst -the absolute worst - is that she says no.take a chance & good luck!
but, i know exactly what i want in a relationship.
i would flirt and send flowers and candies to my self and then he would ask u out sometime
i also hate seeing my dad unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i snore sometime -- most people do, right?
i like sos and need to know if im in love
if you guys truely love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc.
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
however that does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
but he is getting married this month.
but those guys are jerks and you don't want them anwyay.
say will u go out with me!!!!!!!!
and get married only after you've been with a guy for more than _num_ years.
man has penis and woman has clitoris.
seperate the bad thing and move on!
(it would be easier to do if i were mad, though!!
if she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
like i said; he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breathe and ask him.
maybe you and i can get together sometime & we'll find love with one another.
i would be, but i'm just married !
play the field a bit now.
as everyone said... dont get married so early.
just want to know have you been to the doc yet !
pay attention to what the other person says!
just talk your spouse about this
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
i was thinking about a medium pink color, but with what??
ask if they wanna go somewhere with you.
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum.
or do guys really do prefer bigger women?
problem is i really like him.
so id say, they do work out, just not a lot of the times...hope this helps...
should i dump him because of his mother
i did this before (accidentally) and my friend was mad that i deleted him!
i dont think i mind either way.
but thats her way... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open...
there are some that do, but you should be able to tel.
r u talking about ur avatar?
i dont ever remember giving a girl a cristmas gift unless i liked her.
i don't know what to do.
try to be your self and don't show off
so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing.
dang it, if only every man knew what women want the world would be a much happier place!!!
compliments, honesty and make it about her.
i think hse will crash him!
it just means that she is really interested in the guy.
please do.. im thinking you would get slapped mid-reach,or kicked in the groin.
only now she and i are both divorced.
if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex!
hey it's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol!
tell her to move to mass.............
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you shouldn't get married.
the pictures i've seen...i would say maui or the bahamas.
the guy i like is mad at me.
you're _num_ don't even worry about it...
that way you dont have to worry about you calling him too much!
i am a guy and let me tell you, we love to chase!
thanks for the pep in advance!
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away.
they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker.
i don't know....how would you like something crammed up your butt!!
if a guy cares he calls.
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
he probably doesnt want to either.
hold her hands, look to her eyes and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
some guys do...and some guys don't.
hey i really want to know so please help me out!!
the timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy...you'll see!
generally kind and my fifth: i'll just be dissapointed if she's stupid.
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible.
lol so if thats u u deff need to stop that is fonky!!
don't let her rule your life, she will just have to learn to deal with it.
i have yahoo email and that works for me.
i wouldn't worry too much about it.
oh yes, the trick ass hoe's never had a chance.
when you can fart in front of the one your dating
depends on how old they are.
and any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
if you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles.
_num_ to _num_ doesn't have to be younger than you.
my be she don't love you but try to use your brean not your haerd
if you want your girlfriend forever..........then just don't let her know that you want her forever, simple.
there are tons of cheap ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it!
and if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - dont.
find a nother girl and if that dosent work move back
most often (not always) that will be guys around your age, give ot take.
if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate.
not everyone on here is in school.
tell him what you really want...that's what they tell me but never got to do...speak up...
should i make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move ?
what a typical double standard you have set up!!
after a while you dont even see the color.
:) i haven't tried it yet, but i am still trying to get up the nerve....
if you two are serious then asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
sak her out what's up with that?
how about...would you like to go out with me sometime?
yah look me up if you are ever in florida lol!!!
those was good times i tells ya.
its all about her, and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date.
do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time.
if he comes to his senses then great if not screw him!!
you are too good for them
jump him because she likes him??
depending on the age, cds or dvds.
_num_ years down the road that is all you can be so start from the beginning
ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
anyone with any ideas, tips or general info, email me back!!!
u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down.
you dont look, just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and a gf will come along.
don't persue it, he is getting married.
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry?
i mean if in your country there is an short messaging system in your cellphone then find a textmate!!
then when she starts closing her eyes , kiss her in the lipps and then its up to you!
please be honest with me i can handle the truth
have fun, and remember to never get so comfortable that you always know what's going to happen next!
its shows how much they care about you!
tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
coffee, lunch, site seeing, walk/talk/play in the park, museum, movie matinee
what you whant is a hooker, you can find that in any corner of the world.
but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
because if it fails you be up $h*t!
and its been the best thing for at least me.
try using some of these, but only if they actually apply!!!
the problem is that he cheated on me recently and it was the worst that he could of done.
if you are happy she should be happy, unless he really is being bad to you.
we like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back.
tell him you don't want a real relationship.
if you look creepy and you look..they'll all think you're leering.
i don't know about love,but he likes you for sure
if a guy really respects u then he'll understand.
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it, do if you want to.
because he is a superhero that is the closest to being just a regular guy.
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
i dont think it is wise to date at work.
stupid u need a theory class _num_ that!!!!!!!
let it take it's course from there.
about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops?
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off.
guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually.
but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you.
the safest rules of internet dating are these: _num_ chat via email and messenger _num_ chat on the phone.
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
ok, so i had this problem too.
depending on what you kissed ;)
it depends on if you could trust him before!
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
uh- wher've u been meeting these filipinas?
imgaine if it was just considered love??
that way, you aren't exactly telling them what you specifically don't like about them.
if he is, then go for it!
then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie.
hey im sorry i don't know and i wish best of luck to both of you!
however----i find him looking at me every now and then.
this is sin, our selves have started this
fun includes eating meals (not breakfast if yo know what i mean).
make a kind move , if no responce u know what to do !
let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him!
you people have no right to get married!
my tragic love story was i loved him very much and he loved me too.
u seem desperate and you'll never find a if you're desperate.
but he swears that we're just friends.
looks don't really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
again, i know once u have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me.
don't rush it feel all your emotions come alive.
it a two way traffic until you get them you will know which one it is
so you have one baby out of wedlock.
i know i'm overtly picky about people how can i stop it!
it hurts....alot...maybe some girls might say that's it?
im going to jump that boy is that the right choice
so it was a good ideea!
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off.
because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly.
i'd perfer if they left me alone... sorry, i got off-topic.
ask her to go do something she is interested in or to see a movie she'd like.
you are a man <--- term used lightly!!
haha... too bad it's not automatic like msn or aol.
and thats how they'll react to it so yea its bad situation for you and him.
go back to that person at once before it becomes too late for you.
lol i too want to smack that smile off her face
and ask if he wants to dance with you.
then she might say that looks ugly i think (a color) looks better.
ask him to go see a doc.
i never went out with him a second time.
first of all, why did u guys break up?
why wait,,,,, go ahead do it
as long as he dosent mind , who elses opinion matters?
i think im still totally in love w/ him...
i never wanted to have sex again.
the main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
im a gilr, i say those things....
a big savings area is flowers.
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens.
either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
well from your list, i would have to choose spiderman.
i was cheated on for _num_ of the years.
all seniors think freshman girls are easy, its sad but true
and if he says yes than you can tell him.
and impress her with affection and love.
and if you have, what was it like?
celebrate valentine with joy and fun...give eachother gifts and hav a fun...
any women beside the ugly guys will look hot...
so, when i moved in my neighbor asked me out.
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
be yourself say whats up and you might get a response
there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also.
if your talkin hubby or the like i'd say tools toys for his vehicle, sports related things.
that got me really hot, but i ran off.
me, i'll pick up the tab if, i can get your vote for best answer.
k. so what size of breast does the average guy like do you think?
many women _num_ are dating men _num_ so the _num_ yo men feel insecure and have to fish downstream
lust less like...you just go out?
they probobly know you cant really hide that but you should tell your parents
i will make u princess in planet kripton !!
my last girlfriend's bf did that to her (before we met), and she still kept him.
my friend has a bf who she talks _num_ online and on the phone.
do you like fake nails or manicured ones?
tell her, girls like to her the truth good luck
we can restle around and be the best of friends.
stay true to your husband...after all, he's the one you said i do to...
dont listen to these fools with al their b.s.
yeah, im a guy so i dont really have to pay.
remember, no bird ever flew on one wing!!
just let her know what you feel.
it depends, if you really love him you will prob think youll want to egnolage it
if you or the other person is married, run!!!!
no men don't but little boys do
help me win this debate with her !
my girlfriend's the nuttiest, but i love her anyway.
simple enough, do like anyone else does.....play with it.
sweetheart let him go ,if he is ment to be with u he will come back to you
of course after _num_ day of that my back went out lol.
stay alive and get your old life back.
so thats why i ask why dont guyz ever know what they want with any kinda relationship!?!?!
maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing.
girls don't like guys who is all about themselves.
it depends do u like either one???
i was always looking and i kept picking jerks.
so, no i feel its a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
some do,some don't have it in them.
just do what makes you happy!
because for some reason i cannot
so it would have to be love.
because....you know.......try to search you love.....but becareful.....!!!!!!
don't ask her to perform some act for you, make her the spotlight.
girls are simply impressed if u can show a little care, respect and honesty to them.
tell the bastard to get out.
they think it is the only right way!
good luck and keep it cool!
that said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him.
and i hate him for it.
men like this, typically become wife beaters if you don't obey them!
first off, i have _num_ kids....so a homemaker is more work than my job even.
no i haven't..i prefer normal-looking guys
it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel;;u should!!
everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days.
i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front and maybe i told this guy to much.
the right date can save money on lots of things.
if you truly love your man & want to work it out then tell your x to respect that.
that only makes her easier to bed.
don't think you should try it!
simple...honesty and love and try to true with them
i hoping for at least a _num_ but realistically i think its more like _num_ or _num_
but cuddling up with a large women is one of the best feelings i know of.
and women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
a couple of ways: - get him drunk.
the problem is not if u ask her while at work or not.
stick with the _num_ & _num_ year old boys .. they are easier to control anyway.. lol good luck
you never let a man mistreat you
ps im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl.
!,anyway when i left him i swore i,d never get married again!!
pickup lines are tacky..just be yourself and complament her alot..women like that
you'll be fine just have fun!
not all the time, sometimes men shave them, it depends on the woman,
i love him but i think im ready to move oe, meet new guys!
so wait for another _num_ years.
i hope i see some of it soon.
i don't want to be mean.
also u shood wait a while b for having kids.
i would like to have some fun with u that's why i answered this stupid question
try to contact their q&a team..they'll help you through..have a nice day!
because womens don`t put out often...
if he insists, it means he only after sex.
b) looks definitely matter, anyone saying they don't is probably lying.
whle making love is like living a fantasy.
when you _num_ or _num_ because when they said something they dont mean it
when possible, try to make it yourself.
but (there's always a but isn't there?
if she is not into you anymore...
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that many guys.
on average id say about _num_ at first but than one you get to knowthe person maybe _num_
play sports with your guy friends.
she will tell you if it's not ok.
i don't mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful.
how do i get he to stop nagging me and leave me alone.
a sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
men without hair look like little boys to me, and it's not sexy at all.
i agree, just kiss him... he'll respond one way or another.
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her.
here in america it is not so important...
well if it was before you then he wasnt cheating at all... obviously.
man how many times i passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying no......
because the white women are taking up all the men!!
ur self image is also very important.
have you ever had a pap smear.
good god how old are you ?
but i think they both like me.
okay well first thing it sounds as if you guys are already married!.
yes jaime is going to ask rubi out.... but it is not yoru business...
that is a sign, things like that can make it really obvious
u should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them.
i'd love to hear logical opinons on this, thanks
if you like the guy then go for it.
having fun with guy friends is ok. _num_
so its natural with that guy.
women take on alot and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i'm not married yet
let me know what you think, thanks
if you are gay be gay!!!
good luck and hang in there.
i like older girls so i think this is sick and wrong that they cant go out with her
i am just curious to what everyone thinks.
my last bf i met driving round a roundabout in another car!!
becuz if you do then your gonna lose your friend over a guy!!!!
it really was a casual aside when i said it -- i didn't think he would remember.
are you a country girl or a city girl.
hang out all day together and to top it off touch his feet.
im very bored bein single.sittin back watchin other gurlz hava all da fun!
)women are curious about sex with other women, even me!
i don't know what you said because i was to lazy to read your typing.
i hate it my self, i love the straight ones
this is doc izzy and i love and adore bigger women!
there are not any words that are going to make it any better.
do it before it is to late
well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it.
nay pier is a great place or one of the museums....there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels.
thats a stereotype( not a country girl by the way)and i think im sexy in my own way.
he wont turn you down .
well i hope you read this really well.
lots of men like thick girls, most of them are black.
if she's interested she'll call later.
no, you won't because you know he has cheating tendancies.
ask ur self that, if you know what i mean.
i find if i try real hard i can see things i know aren't there normally there.
lets get coffee and chat and take it from there!
just move on with your life and frind some one eles!
ill bet your not, but try to email me atilikethickchix@yahoo.com and i will be honest.
me and this boy been going off and on since last year.
i really care about you and i can't stop thinking about you.
is worth the wait when you are ready.
if you don't know ask someone who would.
keep away ur fear and tell him.
thats a chance your gonna have to take.
so if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps, and pervs drink up!
not for anything but lookin at
after i while i t passes and i still love him
it's your own life, as you said.
(and now even in devorce im stuck with it !
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend doesnt mean he is.
sure let me know more 'bout you
when one minute you want to throttle the other person & the next you want to jump their bones
the girlz that are pretty or have a great personality.
ppl whose parents well take care of them, big time lazy ppl.
i do not know what she wants.
it is very complcated tell it again please but in simple
show her what you're good at.
if u can imagine him as the father of ur children !
if you dont ask sombody else might.
haha thats why i am single!
if you really love him, you would let him go...
if she doesnt want to be with you- try to be her friend.
well if he says he isnt believe him.
lets get it out of limbo ;)
i even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams.
i've been with my husband for _num_ years we recently got married in december of _num_
focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
u'll see that no matter how hurt u r it's still the simplest reason y u smile.
wow i didn't think pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop right away because i'm ready to relieve myself.
whatever you do...do not tell him too soon!!!
we can't answer if she really means it.
i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time.
then u can make an easier decision.
i have sexed many girls and some where whores.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... _num_ points...
talk _num_ your best friend and see if its cool
is this a trick question ?
i don't know can i do anything about it?
people are husbands and wives for reasons!!!
if he doesn't then there are too many fish in the sea.
or just you wanna say that!?
if you aren't happy fix it or get out.
not all guys, but some guys do
i totally agree with udaman...good luck girl
sound like you like to sell yourself to much.
your girlfriend will just think you're a jerk.
sometimes but you have to observe the one you call your man.
replaying everything you ever did to me?
but don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
i dated a guy this past year and he got to the a violent point.
leave it alone-i don't care what she says, she's in enough pain.
how would anyone know if they don't know anything about you?
just find one that loves you too.
it never hurts to be flirty!
we was hangin out a lil.
don't use pick up lines , that's a turn off .
i love them b/c im a guy and i dont have to ask anyone to the dance
girl there are more guys out there that love thick girls than u think?
the girls that whine that flowers don't last are just ungrateful.
u need to be wit that person, you have found your true love
and i mean really be her friend.
how do i get my sweetheart to show me he loves me
well basically you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him
they never met but she says they're in love.
don't do this over the phone, email, etc.
i'm not against gayz and lez's they are the best friends a person can have.
imet a girl and i want to know how to know if shes into me or not
death is like a box full of candy corn
just try and make the best of what's to come.
either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
she's the love of my life and i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
because women think with their brains.
i'm still in love with my ex and i'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
only time will tell spend time with friends have fun don't thimk sbout it
thats why i do not get in chat rooms anymore, unless its to laugh at all the freaks.
ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part.
i have no idea where to begin!!!
but he chaeted, so i guess i can lift or carry my husband.
if she is calling just to bablle then tell her to not call you so often!
thats all i have _num_ say.
you shouldn't be asking this question?
i was also thinking about lime green.
i mean the both of you together.
i have a close girl friend.
wanting to be something they're not?
well, if u can imagine ur self with him in bed @ night!!
they like the challange i know thats what i love about it
depends on the girl i guess... fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
oh man i should do that when im dating next time!
don't listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
i really like this guy, and i don't know if it's just a crush, or if i love him......
i think the bomb is much easier!!
not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years.
dont forget to choose and vote for best answer!!!
..... you tell her why you like her!
did turn gay or is it a curiosity thing?
no, not if you have to ask.
the list could go on and on.
but he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming & teasing.
don't eat where you take a s***.
of course you do wanna chat hit me up fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com
when he teases you about the stupid little things.
if u think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
well, in my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
they are often worse than men!!!
i've heard of friends getting married about _num_ months after meeting somebody.
i don't know what u mean.
if you want kids, then homemaker.
what's the worst that could happen.
intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy!
his/her intelligence,the way they carry themselves,good looks and activeness
sure...and will you pay mine too????
yes all i can say.. but yes, i have long black hair and im proud!!
i was not gonna let her win.
chances r, if u like her as a friend, ull like her as more.
just be yourself when you are with her.
guys think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
find someone u like and say will u be my valentine!
post more questions on yahoo answers!
well,if the one boy picks on you, why like him?
brokeback mountain ,ok it's a guy but at least you'll be happy!
size, shape,looks, ect should not matter at all...
sex is not the only thing important in life damn it!!!!!
you're probably just too good for him anyway.
you like him or you don't like him?
why dont you just ask her if you can kiss her?
whos to say that country girls feel more sexy?
well i dont no how old you are which would help.
just think about what you like and do it back for them....kinda like a tounge massage.
here's my answer: a) most guys definitely do not prefer girls that are skin and bone.
cut your cousin an your ex boyfriend off complete.
or does his friends point at you when your with him.
yes it is very possible to enjoy giving pleasure rather then recieving it
now i keep thinking of getting it on with a girl.
depends on if they are brunette or not
is she just trying to use you?
u can have a big u-no-what, n suck in bed.
get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now.
it hurt like hell and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, playing with each others sex organs before sex.
when he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
my bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up.
you are already doing it so why yet bother?
on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome!
i think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot.
your looking to hard, or maybe you're looking in the wrong places... sign up for yahoo personals
only if you want it to be.
but if she doesn't have a reason then she isn't ur friend!
you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s!
you are definitely not a hoe, don't worry.
girls don't think it's cool, they think it's guys who smoke are pathetic cos they are killing themselves
so - u like asian food?
they don't mean to get them pregnant they just can't keep it in there pants because they are pigs!!!
i like natural / real girls, i don't like fake looking prissy drama queens.
)take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up
that's too many, and selfish ,indeed.... u just desperate n keep on trying another one right?
its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat.
do you know he loves you?
my wife forgives me for alot of things .
first you order one online and the stork brings one to you
i would say around _num_ or _num_
imagine that i am that guy and be my girl freind!
give them a chance to discover you.
its unusal yes, but nothing bad.
i still love him what to do
don't just stay with him for the baby.
and never ignore her always listen to her...and when you do don't change the subjetct women hate that.
it can be good luck also if you take it as good luck.
its a man thing live with it ego
sounds like u r going through a lot right now.
good luck but do your homework!
don't come here, it smells like a trap to me.
everywhere.... just ask any girl passing by.... but only in thailand.... not in us .... lol
this gal does not want a bad boy at all.
but i need to be happy.
you are so full of it, teasing all these desperate lonely sad sad guys, shame on you
also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone.
only that i can say: good luck!
you married your hubby hopefully because you love him .
i love to express my feelings to the ladies with poems, has anybody written one for a special someone.
why tie yourself to just one guy?
that's if u both agreed on doing this.
it's like saying, what's got to stop me when i have already done it?
he just has to start over and earn your trust again.
one his side of his family i met his father.
we fall in love they treat us bad why are we there
i am one of those who want to wait until being totally in love with someone.
but try the nice way first..girls hate being ignored!
keeping secrets only hurt the ones you love.
some women like big hairy guys, some guys like fat women, some gals like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
curves, esp if they have big boobs, and softness........can't beata soft woman
never tell her she's fat big one!!!
you are a mom, act like one!!!
others like think due to society dictates its; i say screw society and give me thick!
give them _num_ months they will get over you.
don't know, but daniel k has never read manga.
i guess it's kind of nice, it's like your dad's blessing all the way.
i like intelligent,fun and hot girls.
come to my town ill be your girl....
this generation is just too stupid.
yeah, time to cash in your chips.
they are always in the 'in love' stage.
i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga.
it was really nice how he asked me out.
try talking to her and ask her to hang out as friends see if it goes somewhere
(this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there).
not what you can become just because she says too.
the two of you should talk privately and personally...you have to clear each other's side..do it now
well, the one i liked goes like this.
do not try to have sex.
just keep it cool, a little hard to get might help!
if your relationship survive the four seasons... i guess you should be ready....
i married my guy anyways and do you know why (besides love).
move on and find someone who doesn't hate you.
you can't, so lets just start asumming it.
yes we like flowers, pretty, good smelling ones
should i or shouldn't i. younger guy vs older woman
ok, those other replies are just cocky, i'm way more fine.
lime green would be more for a summer wedding.
but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry.
my boyfriend snores and i have the most terrible time sleeping!
may be u think not but yes!!!
we have no room for screwed up animals like this in our society.
the best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
his answer is good enough for me...
no single man can give you what you really want.
if he doesn't start acting right, then leave him.
if yor hott too show him your boobies
a lot of guys like that - just looking for sex.
(i mess up alot at times ) but she don't forget.
wait for him to ask u out unless ur real desprete
u are asking do u like me
whatever you decide, make it completly yours!
her parents?u can't fix it... her friends?maybe u can talk to them nicely...but, pls specify , why?
how drunk is this girl getting?
gals luv guys with positive self image.
am doing this just for the points lol
if ya'll don't know anyting about each other u can't connect.
if you do... then i would say it was a real and worth realtionship :) good luck
but really if you're used to it and you kinda like it, go with it.
cause it's buy one take one.
and last but not least--- does he always just happen to be staring...?
it sounds like a con, but i'm telling you, chicks dig it.
you just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better.
however, i always believed in the fact there's a huge different between having sex and making love.
you just have to make yourself walk away.
in my case i think _num_
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead.
i can't see my life without my husband.
i do....much prettier and smooth as silk!
:) although, flowers are really nice even if they don't last.
it sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away.
why don't you just leave the girl alone?
maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so.
i also have not a single girl friend .
just remeber, s go for guys who are themselves and only themselves!
they feel that they are better than womans but there wrong
that doesn't mean you should let them in.
it's always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends to gab with on the fone?
getting married and getting child can wait but studies can't.
but you need to do this a few times.
most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex.
don't look back and enjoy the friends you have.
no good or bad is your personal belief on something.
and i dont know what i should do.
yes it is a sick habit
wait till you get _num_ you would not loose your charm by then.
my bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but i won't.
relax and be real that is what we like.
i dont think so, maybe they should try taking our last names
you both should pick either his or yours once you have kids.
of course he wants to go on.
so i guess i pick domestic goddess.
ask her out after class again.
and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
i am man and i too feel so.... because i too am !!!
if you like him that much,call him.
start with a basic everyday question and go from there :)
tell more ppl (my bor did)
all my friends want to do is makeout!
also actual kissing and asking if your a good kisser...
we will not regret it.at ur service anytime.
u need to reput it in add it back just like first time
you can share this with ur mom or dad.
and don't fall for the alcoholic only on weekends line that the guy above is giving.
you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
i prefer a & b cups, myself.
be her friend first then see where it goes
dont even listen to what people not just guys say, watch how they act.
do u fell that way ?
but if a guy asks u dont be afraid to say no.
obviously she don't want you if you know she likes the other boy!
there are lots of things that make a woman not like sex.
not all guys get bored and move on.
but -- there's no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
depending on what yo uare looking for, freindship only, like.
i did this with my current boyfriend.
but it doesn't mean you cannot love another.
just divorce that guy... he has no honour and he dont love you.
basicaly men just want to have girlfriend for free sex!!!
if nothing work ... u have to ask him for it again :-)
its ur personalitie, keep to it, whether a guy goes out with u shouldnt determin how u act.
you have to search yourself for this one...
if the guy is worthy enough, u wont need to
i'm confused i hate the girl to be like that ... what shall i do ?
shop around for invitations and everything else!
he then asked me, can i come with you?
just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it.
so i'm only myself around guys i dont like, and you know the outcome.
i hope you find a nice girl.
ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade.
to all my fellow girls at cone, a big hi and hug!
if shae like him then there is a reson .
if going to a movie is special for the _num_ of you, then do that.
it just sounds like u wear the pants.
have you told her that it's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday?
for the same reason thin girls prefer slender tonned guys
he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number.
go to hawaii...ha ha ha or ....pay someone...lol
i don't understand why people think it's wrong.
keep seaching for a believer in romance, she's out there!
if you plan on cheating on your wife...you're a freaking pig and need to be shot!
look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
confront him and ask him that way you will know
it's more of a trust issue i'd say.
never stop trying to impress her .
no , you are punish , and no tv for a month
lol i think this is better than the one on top of me...
but that didnt bother me, because like i said wa&#_num_;e were just friends .
go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends.
wow, go with the one that picks on you because _num_ times out out _num_ he likes you
i always felt the same way, but i met my true love and my views changed!
take baths ?know how to speak ?
i like him and he says stuff like, if i weren't dating _ i would go out with you?
just get rid of him you will be better off
the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love!
people asked me - whats the hurry?
has he just dumped a girl and left before?
needless to say, im _num_ now and still in therapy around it.
and for god sakes do not be one of those controling baby mama's.
did you ever think of that?
its been half a year- is it normal _num_ still like him??
look for a man that's hot!
it is realy sweet and just what u r looking for!
is there a reason that your not w/the baby's dad?
no!no!no!it certainly is most uncool.u r simply wasting ur health cos girls just hate it.
anything bigger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d
i myself think that they do.
stop trying to slap it in everyones face!!!
you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable.
...a guy asks me, 'do you mind if we cuddle?
or ask about the score of last game?
because some couples never get to that comfortable boring stage.
i always say that you shouldn't do things if your gonna regret them later.
even the day after would be okay.
well all ur missing is a million dollar smile..:)
and i hear ya fountain...same thing happened to me.
altho, i dont really like girls all that much.
be really nice and give eye contact and smile a lot.. hope this helps!
i would wonder why he shaved them but, in the end, they're his legs!
best of luck to you both :)
this is just what i have nurt many times.
i'll go with anything natural than fake i even hate the word fake
no _num_ years younger, who wants an older women?
ask your best friend if it'd be okay.
many people will tell you no!
downtown houston just about any weekend... lots of clubs...
who said women dont feel anything?
and don't start with her looks, mister!
if they have moved on then you should too.
flirt and see how he reponds
i am waiting till im married but when is it too far?
wit her takin ur number, there's nothing wrong wit that.
and you don't have to be an overly happy hyper-active person.
i dont wanna just randomly go up nd be like go out wiht me?
then comes the fun part...he making it up to you :-)
you give at least _num_ minutes for kissing and huging and may be some licking also .
i can't help any more unless i have more infor.
cause i say no on avatars
some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them...something that lasts.
he is probably wondering if your interested in him at all....flirt back!!
i feel goofy, dorky, and happy.
if your a hoe then he's one to...i personally don't think your one tho
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
i don't need a trophy girl i want a companion.
as a guy - let me say this.
be confident,always believe in yourself.do not be arrogant though.always make good eye contact.listen to what she has to say.
then he said do you want some of my chapstick?
there isn't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
because we love them its not until later when we think about it that what we have done.
i would not know... i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you did
it's like breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it wouldn't seem psycho cuz u have kno each other for a long time
hell yeah for the first answer.that girl answered for me.
or, what about blue and green?
a life of your own....a life you've been missing out on.
confusing... yeah, i think your right.
thing is, you don't have too ask her out to go out with her.
maybe he's going to call you!
ok, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
in a park when i was _num_ i lost my virgenate
what guy doesn't like big boobs.
you should be proud of yourself.
yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do?
we dont no what you look like !
if you could have _num_ qualities in your woman, what would they be.
look in the internet u will find lots of things for the wedding or your local newspaper or news
if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off.
see my boyfriend (go to my _num_)?
u'll find a man who really deserves u one day).
well, you, and that sexy perfume you wear!!
if he isn't and you're still not ready, then screw him!
why do they want it state sanctioned?
and she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons!!!!!
move on, but you can still luv him!!
see if he is willing to go out the way for you.
if anyone know let me know
i never knew life could be so good!!!!
and he said that he would call me back.
pick the one you like the most.
take it off pop up block
if you truely love him you will tell him
who knows but i would absouletly love that _num_ be done _num_ me.
what shuld i do to get her ?
dude, you have to suck it up and introduce yourself.
there are movies that i haven't seen yet.
i think it all depends on age, upbringing, .
and that will be just s*x!
my boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss!
who gives a crap what anyone else thinks.
also try getting some blonde highlights
just let it all out, i use art a lot to vent problems that i have.
if she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
it could be ( choose one & why? )
don't worry what people will say.
i think a lot of girls like getting flowers.
i can't explain it...and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable or submissive.
let him go... either that or date his brother!
yes there are you just have to look.
you can get them in staples for _num_
your kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a dad.
my friend says i am to nice and i should tell them no.
my girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class, butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
that's right, the right relationship happened on it's own.
you will look like an idiot.
no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him.
i thnk u shud b ur tru self, hav self esteem, self confidance
anything that is not nailed down!
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad
one of my best friends had a thing with my big sister a few months ago.
should i just forget it and move on?
there friends on the other hand, thats a different story...
ummm yes i do i think anyone does!!
my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying he was a hot teen that she met online
none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife :d
i have long black hair and i love it,hubby loves it too.
you care your family and everybody in your family will love you.
ugly (or fat) guys just take what they can get.
in the middle of the river while there was ppl watching it was actually pretty fuuny!!
its all in the eye contact
depends on the guy some guys do some don't
it kind of gives us an idea that you may not have strong guts.
i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father.
yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman.
maybe she's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
it does sound a little girlie.
if you want to enjoy a bit - why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms etc
there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place.
hey, its like, everyone's gotta seperate some day or the other.
you win some you lose some take it with a grain of salt and be more carefull next time
happy birth day to you .
i just need someone to help me figer this out
pick the _num_ w/ better treatment towards u
i'm into a _num_ grade boy too!
if you end it he might not be your friend thats why i dont go with friends
stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact
do whats best for you and he
bad teeth , bad breath and bad bo.
no one needs to know that!
if i am to ask, i'll then leave, stop the relationship and move on with my life.
hey, do not get me wrong.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
where am i going with this?
keep getting her younger and younger guys as one gets old get a new one for her...
you know that's if u didn't play the guilt trip.
that doesn't mean it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
it is a mistake that can't be undone!
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue, and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue.
you catch her looking at you?
i know _num_ guys that i can probably get away with doing something like that.
ask her out or tell her u like or admire her.
if he's gonna be an on and off guy like that i say dump him _num_ good!
if they dont then you'll have to get on with your life.
i have never been to it
complement her...ask her name...dont act weird...act like u r the smoothest guy ever.
she calls him all the time.
is how should i approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her?
wait a little while then date guys that way you enjoy it more.
someone who's never 'bitchy' just because she thinks it's cool...it ain't.
b/c you dont have any decision power what to do
i know... why should i hide it?
some guys just don't like to dance.
truly she isn't ur friend, b-cuzz she won't stop bugging u!
i wish i had listened to my friends
after how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she isn't really interested?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married???
no brainer oh and nice picture of george clooney on your profile lmao
some woman cannot seem to find guys their own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that were not too big
it sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are.
so so sexy yes it look very nice on most any girl
sometimes its better to be very good friends first and make sure ur happy around each other
anyway my question is.... will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill - love ain't like that its a great example
child please, dont ask that question if you dont want your feelings hurt
and the gf should accept that about if she loves you.
i think it's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs.
if u guys still keep in touch---i dont think thats the best thing to do.
i like this boy austin and i told my friend claudia to ask hin if he likes me
you are killing the romance by popping up that stupid question, ever thought of having fun together instead?
he's a player...no good trust me...
it depends they all like different _num_ but not selfsenterd freaks like u
i think thats fantastic, maybe you should do the first move!
if he turns you down, hes not worth it in the first place!!!!
well just go up to her.
it's a good idea to always be honest...besides not many guys i know don't like being told they're hot!
they know the women will not chase them like good looking or wealthy men who get tons of chicks.
just face him, say hey i like you wanna see a movie?
thats why they call it making love.
smile to him once in a while...then he will know...
most girls are polite she'll answer it
i would... you sound alot like my best friend.
say hey(whateverhisnameis) when ya taking me to dinner???
it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously don't care.
if you want it to work out it will .
if he doesn't want to dance, then give it up.
but you know what, i feel the guy should make the first move.
without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty.
wait take it from a military girl wait!!
you never know gurl they never show efection only when they want somthing
i am _num_ yrs of age and looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly?????
do you mean seem more sexy?
go to deleted items and it should be there
this is a red flag of how this guy is.i wonder!
may be becaues your name is freakgirl but if you show your face maybe not no hard feelings
that would be sooo painful you know,trust me been there done that!
do u love her in depth?
have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate.
;) nah the only time u see a man emotional is when he is with his lady luv!
yes i have done it it was a lot of fun.
gotta let the person you are with know what u want.
ofcourse, if she calls like _num_ times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
hang in there for one that apprecaites you.
my mom books them all of the time pat@alanatvl.com
besides don't you think he has enough to worry about?
ive been dating this guy that's younger than me.
men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
it's got to get played out after a while.
everybody likes to be told that they're hot, even if they don't admit it!
yes but it dipends of the guy
mabey because ou just think they look sexy when they are running on the feild
your too young to be talking about kissing already.
i prob will tell her soon cuz shes my best friend ha well any help would be nice.
i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt
i'm ready to move on, but i love him way too much!
go out & do everything you couldn't when you were with him/her!
obviously, men ain't much better ;-)
what if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits.
play a truth or dare game together
he sounds like a manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace maybe, fourplay,
death is like a big black bag full of of crack or smack or meth.
practice kissing me were do you live?
no you wont huni......i was married to a complete arsehole!!!!
sounds like you really love her...no need to forget her!
tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb!!!
it always finds a way to get out in the open, just don't do it!
and yuck, what is with chest hair?
as for now i think he is mad, hurt, upset and got over you.
give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike!!
no offense, but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended!
be cool and ask her on a date!
well after u take her out get to know her some and then go _num_ the kill,ask her out
people don't like to be played yo-yo with.
practice to unrap starburst wrappers with your tounge, the girls love it!
i don't know!...i just want the points...lol
that's not exactly true.... it's just that most girls are discreet about it...
that depends...are you a hottie w/a body?
i told him it was too late...other than that, i wouldn't have minded getting flowers sometimes.
believe in is a strange way to put it.
why can't men (or boys in your case) ever say the word love?
just enjoy the age you are and don't worry about all this.
though i'm _num_, i like anything up to _num_?
i had a friend in the same situation.
girls are just as perverted--trust me.
you shouldn't go out with a guy because you 'need' to.
dude, what your sayin is she doesn't want to be more than bf and gf?
is it usually about a year before both people begin _num_ feel in that comfortable,boring, stage??
probably because i knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until i met my wife.
i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
but some guys would do that... why?
if your the average guy breast size shouldn't matter.
stay far far away from guys who can't say i like you.
yea ask for permission by all means and watch how fast she slap the s--- out you
honey my husband likes me for me.
my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me.
then be your best self, if he's impressed or likes you he'll talk back
you dont want anyone else but that person ever
why don't you try chatting/seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
but it is okay to kiss on the first date.
guys have a problem with secrets.
i had someone get nasty with me because i was still dating?
so how do i just kiss him
i am the maid of honor for my only sister and i want it to be perfect!
unless it's with the wrong man.
