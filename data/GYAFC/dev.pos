when will people in this damaged world finally realize this?
i would not take the trouble to call him back.
attempt not to spend time with him and search for another man.
search for another attractive woman and she will be jealous.
therefore, in my opinion, you are not promiscuous.
colors have associations with feelings.
if she likes him over you, you should dump her. it is not his fault she is unfaithful.
if you do not contact me after _num_ days, i might start to forget about you.
you will find a girl who has talents and is attractive.
there is no one you can trust more then a good friend.
start the day with breakfast and a good walk.
if she says yes, pick her up.
why do i hear some girls say that flowers are not going to last?
it might be interesting for them.
could it ever be the same?
it is not that bad; at least it is not bella.
could it possibly be because some men are liars and big mouths?
or you could just tell her and then have one of those fairy tale romances.
finally, a culture that has it correct.
my twin will not talk nor listen to me.
go ahead and get something that you cannot get rid of.
i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams with him in them.
i think it would be passable for you to get a video/computer game.
you should go for it, and take the chance.
if he cannot, then take him to a place where they have music to slow dance to, or a dinner date.
i feel as if this is the most beautiful thing about family life.
it is your choice not to hate one. i dislike them, to say the least.
you should never get married without a prenuptual agreement.
you should pursue an active life and not waste my time.
is she saying the thinks you are too good for her?
relationships with men end, but friends are forever.
it could mean any number of things.
it is normal, because there are a lot of people who still like someone that they broke up with.
i would like to see what an african-american has to say about this.
men are daft, who knows why they do what they do.
you do not have to wait at all, if they gave you their phone number.
because we were, masters of the universe.
i am in love and i do not care who it, buddy the elf.
do not try to have both of the at once, no matter what.
if you truly wanted to be with him, you would not have to ask.
remember, being friends with someone online is okay, however, there are limits.
when my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes to get prepared.
now me, i wouldn't marry any woman who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
small party for the family.
girls are perverts, they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly.
i'm only in fifth grade.
but you do what you want.
do not do that, it will not work.
it is time to move on if they do not.
he has everything that i could ever want, handsome, financially secure, etc.
it is bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.
no, she isn't lying.
be quiet, and live the truest version of yourself.
he has his nose pierced.
i can't lift him, and he is only _num_ pounds.
you should have a therapist for that.
perhaps some vulgar young men enjoy the younger asian ladies.
you should make an appointment with a therapist!
giving you ridiculous excuses, off of the wall! acting differently than he did before!
be tough and hang in there.
absolutely not, he is too hefty and i am undesirably frail.
basically, it is very unattractive if she is so inebriated that she becomes a promiscuous ragamuffin.
keep in touch by exchanging letters and emails, enjoy online chats and phone calls, and even sending each other packages.
you do not have to especially if you do not feel like it.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores two points.
giving it up just for him to stay with you is like selling your soul to the devil.
i cannot give you a wife view, but hopefully mine is just as good.
it also takes the pressure off of me to ask someone.
it depends on the woman, but it is better shaved.
please ask the question in english; i am unable to understand you.
hello, i am a male, but i will tell you a little bit.
i do like him a lot and i want to win him over, not push him away.
i like this man; however, i am uncertain whether he also likes me.
your avatar looks familiar to me.
i just cannot seem to move on even after six months.
perhaps he is concerned about rejection, and you should act as i would, which is to ask.
you must think about that, which should help you decide whether you can trust him.
a picture of the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated, that is special.
i am in college and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
listen, it is not easy because i got with my ex-boyfriend in _num_ grade, _num_ grade, and _num_ grade.
i have been with this girl for _num_ months and we have not kissed, is that bad?
some guys do not like breasts at all.
or that she just desires to go out with other people?
and he has seen me every day for approximately four or five years!
there was his stop so he left the train.
you should take a chance because the worst outcome is that she says no.
i know, however, what i want in a relationship.
consider flirting and sending flowers and candies to yourself, and he may then ask you out.
also, i dislike it when my father is unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i do snore sometimes. don't most people?
i like scott and need to know if i am in love.
if the two of you truly love each other, then you can work out all of your disagreements.
because neither one of you have the guts to call it quits yet.
however, that certainly does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
he is getting married this month.
those men are dolts and you do not want them anyway.
just ask, "will you go out with me?"
get married only after you have been with a man for more than two years.
a man has a penis, and a woman has a clitoris.
you need to seperate the bad thing and move on.
if i were mad, it would be easier to do.
if she tells the admininstration, i will be expelled because it is pakistan, and not america.
you should get to know her, and one of you will ask the other out.
like i said, he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breath, and ask him.
maybe you and i can gt together sometime. perhaps even find love in one another.
i would be, but i am married.
play the field a little bit.
as everyone said, don't get married so early.
i just want to know, have you been to the doctor yet?
pay attention to what the other person says.
simply communicate with your spouse about this.
if you are interested in sixth graders, you are obviously young.
i was considering a medium pink color, but paired with what?
ask them if they would like to go somewhere with you.
i would like a trip to an amusement park, or a museum.
do goys prefer bigger women?
it can work out, just not all the time.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i accidentally did this before and my friend was mad that i deleted him!
i do not think i mind either way.
but that is her way. you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open.
there are some that do but you should be able to tell.
are you referring to your avatar?
i do not recall ever giving a girl a christmas gift unless i cared for her.
i do not know what to do.
attempt to be authentic and do not act ostentatiously.
simply proceed one step at a time. consider how he lost a something positive.
if only every man would watch "what women want" the would be a much happier place!
compliments, honesty, and focus on her.
i think he will crush him!
it means she is interested in him.
please try. i think you will be slapped mid-reach, or kicked in the groin.
she and i are both divorced.
does she want to see a picture of you right away?
it is better then giving her a fake number.
she need to move to massachusetts.
if you feel so strongly about it, perhaps you should not get married.
from the photographs i have seen, i would say maui or the bahamas.
the man i like is angry with me.
you are _num_, do not concern yourself with it.
do not worry about calling him too much.
i am a guy and we like to chase women.
thank you in advance.
we always seems to push away the ones that we love.
they think that they can control other people's lives.
that is odd, but perhaps, i will talk to my friend by his locker.
i am not sure, how would you like to have an article forced into your derriere.
if a man cares about you, then he will call.
what is a special gift that i may give my future brother in law on his birthday?
it is probable he does not want to either.
hold on to her hands, gaze in her eyes and say it, however, only say this is you really love her.
some men do, others do not.
i would really like to know, if you could please help me.
the timing with the older man was not right, you will see.
generally kind and i will be disappointed if she is stupid.
it is one of the gifts that we are always able to give ourselves.
i do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible?
so, if that is you, you sincerely need to stop as that is most unorthodox.
do not allow her to dominate your life for she will simply have to learn to deal with it.
i have yahoo email, and that works for me.
i would suggest not worrying about it overmuch.
yes, the promiscuous women never had a chance.
when you can pass gas in front of the one with whom you are in a relationship.
it depends on their age.
any man that says that he would, is probably not being entirely honest with himself.
if you philander him, then the challnge is not there.
if you need you ex emotionally, then you are going to have some troubles.
she does not have to be younger than you, _num_-_num_ will do.
try to use your brain and not your manhood, maybe she does not love you.
do not let your girlfriend know that you want her forever.
there are plenty of cheap ides out there; you just need to find what you like and work at it.
if you are skeptical about the performance piece of it, then do not do it.
try another woman and if it fails, then move back.
most often that will be guys around your age.
if you act like that all the time she might think you are desperate.
not everyone on here is in school.
tell him what you really want; that is what they tell me even though they never got to do that, so speak up.
should i make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move?
what a typical double standard you have.
after a while you don't even see the color.
i haven't tried it yet but i am still trying to get up the nerve.
if you two are serious, asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
ask her out, what's up with that?
would you like to go out with me sometime?
yes, look me up if you are ever in florida.
i tell you, those were good times.
it is all about her. no, it should not be something that happens on a first date.
do you honestly want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time?
if he comes to his senses, then great, if not, break up with him.
you are too good for them.
have sex with him because she likes him?
it depends on the age, but cds or dvds.
twenty years down the road, that is all you can be. so, start from the beginning.
i would like to visit the united states of america. what things would i need.
anyone who has any ideas, tips, or general information, please email me back.
you sound like a very lovely person, do not let these women drag you down.
you do not look, just go out, enjoys yourself, have fun, and a special woman will come along.
do not pursue it, he is getting married.
clear liquid turns yellow when it has dried.
if there is a short messaging system in your country, then find someone great at texting.
when she starts to close her eyes, kiss her on the lips. the rest is up to you!
please be honest with me. i can handle the truth.
have fun, but remember not to get so comfortable that what happens next is predictable.
it shows you how much they care about you.
tell her that you love her and miss her.
some enjoyable things to do include having coffee, lunch, site seeing, playing in the park, going to a movie matinee or museum or just walking, talking and playing.
what you want is a prostitute and you can find that in any corner of the world.
now we do so many things together and i do not know what to do.
if it fails, then you will be up a creek without a paddle.
at least for me, it has been the best thing.
if they apply, then try using some of these.
the worse thing he could have done, and did, was recently cheat on me.
if you are happy, then she should be happy. unless, he really is being bad to you.
we like it when men think about us, and perform tasks for us.
maybe he will call you back eventually, if you give him space.
tell him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you look creepy when you stare, the will think that you are leering.
i do not know about love but he certainly cares for you.
if a man truly respects you then he will understand.
consult yourself and come to a decision. if you can afford it then do it if you are inclined.
because he is the superhero that most resembles an average man.
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if there are more positives than negatives.
it is not wise to date work colleagues.
you should take a theory class.
let it take its course.
you are asking what their stance is about gay relationships?
i asked him if he was blowing me off.
guys will think you are attractive no matter what.
i do not think that not having sex with him will make him unfaithful toward you.
the safest rules of internet dating is to chat via email and the phone.
marriage is really about trust and communication.
ok, i have had this problem too.
what did you kiss?
could you trust him before?
do not make her hate you just to get your point across.
where have you been meeting these filipinas?
was it concidered love?
that way, you are not telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
if he is, then go ahead.
then, see if she is open for dinner and a movie.
hello, i apologize, i do not know. i wish the best of luck to the both of you.
however, every now and then, i find him looking at me.
this is sin, we started this.
fun includes eating meals, and i do not mean breakfast.
make a nice gesture, if there is no response, you will know what to do!
let him approach you first. if you approach it will make you look obsessive of him.
i prefer you not marry.
i lived him very much, and he loved me too. that is my love story.
you apprear desperate and you wil never find someone if you are desperate.
he says we are just friends.
looks do not matter unless you are trying to prove something.
i know that once you have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
the fact that a guy is self centered is a huge red flag to me.
do not rush it and feel all your emotions come alive.
it is a two-way street until you get in a relationship with them, and then you know which way it will be.
you have one child. are you married?
how can i stop being overtly fastidious about people?
perhaps some women would say that it hurts a lot.
that man is the right choice. i am going to ask him to go out with me.
so it was a excellent idea.
if she gets intoxicated then it is not a turn off.
because some women send men tiny messages without saying it clearly.
i would prefer if they left me alone, and i apologize that i got off-topic.
ask her to go do something that she is interested in, or see a movie that she would like.
you are a man, and i use that term lightly.
ha, ha. too bad it is not automatic, like msn or aol.
that is how they will respond, so yes. this is a bad situation for you and for him.
go back to that person at once before it is too late!
i, too, want to smack the smile off of her face!
ask him is he wants to dance with you.
she may think that looks unattractive. in my opinion, blue looks better.
ask him if you should go see a doctor.
i did not go out with him for a second date.
firstly, why was the relationship not terminated?
delay for what reason? proceed to accomplish your intent.
in the event he has no objection, what other person has a relevant viewpoint?
i believe i persist in feeling all-consuming romantic love for him.
i wished to never again have sexual activity.
it is critical that you do not seek revenge agains the one who wronged youl
i do not think you are ready if you have to ask other people.
i say those things and i am female.
you can save money with respect to flowers.
you will know in time, and i recommend seeing what happens for six months.
either that, or you are the only one he has a chance of having sex with.
well, from your list, i would have to choose "spiderman".
i was cheated on for three of those years.
all seniors believe freshman girls are loose. it is sad, but true.
if he says yes, then you can tell him.
impress her with affection and love.
if you have, what was it like?
celebrate valentine's day with happiness, gift-giving, and fun.
any woman looks attractive when standing beside an unattractive man.
when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor.
you probably should act because he appears to be shy.
it becomes more difficult as time passes.
if you act yourself and ask about what is happening, you might get a response.
there are several times that you love the man, but are not sure he also loved you.
if you are talking husband or the like, i would say tools, toys for his automobile and items related to sports.
that made me really angry, but i left.
me, i'll pick up the bill, if i can have your vote for the best answer.
okay. so what size of the breast does the general man enjoy, do you believe?
a lot of women date older men, so men feel insecure and date younger women.
did you go on a date?
you should tell your parents. you can not hide.
i want you to be mine.
i know someone who had that happen, and she still dated the guy.
my friend has a boyfriend who she talks to online and over the phone.
do you like false nails or manicured nails?
tell her. women like to hear the truth. good luck.
we can wrestle together and be best friends.
remain faithful to your husband. after all, you married him.
don't listen to any of these other people's answers.
i am a man, so i don't have to pay.
remember, no bird has ever tried to fly with one wing.
just be honest about your feelings towards her.
it depends. if you really love him you will probably want to draw it out.
if you or the other person is married, run!
no, men do not, but little boys do.
please help me win this debate against her!
my girlfriend is strange, but i love her anyways.
it is quite simple, just do what everyone else is doing.
it is time to forget about him, if you two are meant to be he will return to you.
after three days of that activity, i began to have problems with my back.
stay alive and get your old life back.
that's why i ask, why don't guys ever know what they want with any kind of relationship?
you might ask him out to lunch or a movie or something.
girls don't like guys who are all about themselves.
it depends, do you like either one?
i keep going on dates with men who turn out to be rude.
it is a choice, and you should do what is comfortable to you.
some people do not have it in them.
do what makes you happy.
i can not go.
therefore it must be love.
as you know, you should search for love but carefully.
do not ask her to perform an act for you; make her the one being noticed and adored.
women are impressed if you show care, respect, and honesty towards them.
tell the rude man to leave.
they think that way is the only right way.
good luck and stay calm.
if you want to stay married, you need to find yourself.
i do not care for him.
men with these characteristics typically become wife beaters if you disobey them.
first of all, i have four kids, so being a homemaker is more work than my regular job.
no, i have not. i prefer normal looking guys.
it definitely looks like he has feelings for you. do you show him how you feel? you should!
everything seems so open and hit and run these days with most people.
i have a problem in that i unload all of my junk up front. perhaps i told this guy too much.
the right date can save money on plenty of things.
if you truly love your man and want to work it out, then tell your past partner to respect that.
that only makes her easier to have sexual intercourse with.
i do not think you should try it.
simple honesty, love, and trying to be true to them.
it is more like _num_ or _num_ and not _num_
i like the feeling of cuddling with a large woman.
why should men grow up if women expect men to act like that?
you can get him drunk.
is is not a problem if you ask her while at work or not.
stick with the thirteen and fourteen year old boys, they are more simple to control anyway, good luck.
you never let a man treat you the wrong way.
also, i am not a stay at home, romantic dinner kind of lady.
when i left him, i swore i would never get married, again.
pickup lines are unseemly. be yourself and compliment her a lot because women enjoy that.
you will be fine. have fun.
not all of the time. sometimes shave, it depends on the woman.
i love him but i think i am ready to move on and meet new guys.
wait another four years.
i hope i can see some of it soon.
i do not want to be mean.
you should wait a while before having kids.
i would enjoy having some fun with you, that is why i answered this silly question.
you should try to contact their question and answer team and they will help you through it; have a good day!
because women do not have sex often.
if he insists, then it means that he only wants to have sex.
looks definitely matter and anyone who says that they do not is likely lying.
making love is like living a fantasy.
when you are _num_-_num_, sometimes you say what you do not mean.
try to make it yourself, when possible.
there is always an exception, correct?
she is not that into you anymore.
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that many men.
on average, i would say about _num_ at first, but then once you get to know the person, perhaps _num_
you should play sports with your male friends.
she will tell you if it is not alright.
i do not mean, do you believe women are beautiful?
how do i get him to stop bothering me and leave me be.
an intimate, adult toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
men that do not have hair appear as little boys to me, and it is not attractive whatsoever.
i agree, just kiss him, he will respond either way.
a good way is to try and imagine yourself without him or her.
it is not so important here in america.
well, if it was prior to his relationship with you, then obviously he was not being unfaithful at all.
man, how many times have i passed up a great opportunity because i worried about someone saying "no" to me?
because the white women are taking up all of the men!
your self-image is also very important.
have you ever had a pap smear?
good god how old are you?
but i think they both like me.
ok, first thing is that it sounds as if you guys are already married.
yes, jaime is going to ask rubi out, but it is not your business.
that is an indication. things such as that can cause it to be readily apparent.
you should take the time to become acquainted with both equally without dating either of them.
i would be very pleased to hear logical opinions on this topic. thank you.
if you care for the man then proceed.
enjoying yourself with male friends is acceptable.
so it is natural with that guy.
women take on too much, and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i am not married yet.
let me know what you think.
if you are a homosexual then be a homosexual.
good luck and do not give up.
i like older women so i believe it is strange and wrong that they cannot go on a date with her.
i am merely curious about what everyone thinks.
i met my previous boyfriend by driving in a roundabout in another car.
you are going to loose your friend over a guy.
i did not think he would remember, it was casual when i said it.
do you like the country or city?
you can be together all day, and touch his feet.
i do not like being single. i watch everyone else have fun.
women are curious about sex with other women, even myself!
i do not know what you said. i was too lazy to read your response.
i hate it. i love the straight ones.
this is doctor izzy speaking. i love and adore plus-size women!
no words will make the situation better.
you should take action before it is too late.
to tell the truth, you will learn, but you must experience things.
navy pier and the museums are great to visit. there are also many great restaurants and hotels.
that is a sterotype, and i am not a country girl. i think i am attractive in my own way.
he will not turn you down.
i hope you read this well.
many men prefer curvy women, most of them are african american.
if she is interetsted, she will call you later.
no, you will not because you know he has cheating tendencies.
ask yourself that; if you know what i mean.
i find that if i try really hard i can see things i know are not there normally.
let us get coffee and talk, and we will take it from there.
just move on with your life and find someone else.
i will bet that you are not, but try to email me at ilikethickchix@yahoo.com and i will be honest.
this man and i have been on and off since last year.
i really care about you and i cannot stop thinking about you.
when you are ready, it is worth the wait.
if you do not know, then ask someone who would.
push away your fear and tell him.
that is a chance you are going to have to take.
so drink up, if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps and perverts!
good for nothing, but enjoying visually.
after awhile it passes and i still love him.
as you stated, it is your life.
even in divorce i am stuck with it!
just because he has potential to be a great boyfriend does not make him one.
sure, tell me more about yourself.
one minute you want to throttle the other person and the next you want to jump on them.
i like girls who are pretty or have a great personality.
people whose parents take care of them can be very lazy.
i do not know what she wants.
that sounded very complicated. please tell it again, but in simple terms.
demonstrate your skills to her.
if you can imagine him as the father of your children.
if you do not ask someone else then i may.
i am laughing because that is why i am single.
if you really do love him, then you would allow him to go.
if she does not want to be with you, then try to be her friend.
well, if he says that he is not, you should believe him.
let us get it out of the uncertain part.
i worked there for a time, and met the man of my dreams.
i have been with my husband for four year. we just recently got married in december of _num_
focus on how things are and what would be best for you at this moment.
you will see that no matter how hurt you are, it is still the simplest reason as to why you smile.
i did not think that pakistan was that conservative.
i have to stop right away because i am ready to relieve myself.
do not tell him too soon.
we cannot answer if she means it.
i do not like men that does that all of the time.
you can make an easier decision, then.
i have had sex with many girls and some where not the best quality.
he dribbles, he shoots, and he scores two points.
talk to your best friend and see if it is alright.
is this a trick question?
i do not know. can i do anything about it?
people become husbands and wives for real reasons.
if he does not, then move on, there are way too many fish in the sea.
do you want to say that?
if you are not happy, you need to fix it or break up.
not all guys enjoy that, but some guys do.
i agree with udaman.
it sounds like you are selling yourself too much.
your girlfriend will thing that you are a jerk.
sometimes, but you must observe your boyfriend.
replaying everything you ever did to me, correct?
but do not merely sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
i was in a relationship with a man earlier this year and he became violent.
leave it alone. i do not care what she says. she is in enough pain.
how would anyone know if they do not know anything about you?
just find one that loves you too.
it never hurts to flirt!
we were spending a small amount of time together.
do not employ flirtatious dialogue; such behavior isn't appealing.
i adore those people since i'm male and i'm not required to invite a date to the affair.
woman, more men exist in the world with a fondness for overweight women, contrary to your beliefs.
the females that complain about the short existence of flowers are simply unappreciative.
you need to be with that person; you have found your true love.
i mean you should truly be her friend.
how can i get my sweetheart to show me that he loves me?
the bottom line is that you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking of him.
they have never met in person but she says they are in love.
do not do that over the phone or email.
i am not againt homosecuals, they are very good friends.
i met agirl recently, and i want to know if she likes me.
death is like a box full of cnady corn.
you need to try and make the best of what is going to come.
you need to move on with your life, or try to make it work with this person.
she is the love of my life, and i can not wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
since females experience thought via their brain activity.
i still have feelings for my ex and i'm furious with my cousin due to my ex now liking her.
the passage of time will reveal the truth. socialize with buddies, enjoy yourself, put it out of your thoughts.
therein lies the reason for my nearly non-existent chatroom attendance. i rarely go, save for a desire to be amused by the weirdos.
this is what i did, it was a big mistake on my part.
i have no idea where to begin!
he cheated, so i guess i can carry my husband.
if she calls just to ramble then tell her not to call so often!
that is all i have to say.
do you think you should be asking this question?
another option that i am considering is lime green.
i am referring to the two of you collectively.
i have a woman who is a close friend.
are you wanting to be someone you are not?
can you imagine yourself in bed with him at night?
i love that they like the challange.
it depends on the girl. fair skin ladies look extra pale if they have black hair.
i should do that, the next time i am dating someone.
do not listen to what anyone else try to tell you to do.
i really like this man. i am not sure if it is love or just an infatuation.
in my opinion, the bomb is much easier.
they have been fairly favorable years, not always the easiest.
do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer!

did you turn gay or is it just a curiosity thing?
no, not if you have to ask.
it is a very long list.

his/her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks and activeness.
yes, will you pay for me as well?
yes, i am proud of my long, black hair.
i was not going to let her win.
chances are if you like her as a friend, you will like her if you are in a relationship.
when you are wither her, just be yourself.

find someone you like and ask them to be your valentine.
post more questions on yahoo anwers!
well, why do you like the one boy who picks on you?
i would say brokeback mountain; you will be happy even if it is a man.
size, shape, looks, and other surface features should not matter at all.
intercourse is not the only important thing in life.
you are most likely too good for him.
do you like him or not?
what's the reason for not simply requesting permission to exchange kisses with her?
who's qualified to classify country women as possessing more sex appeal?
well, i have no knowledge of your age, which would be of assistance.
merely contemplate those things you enjoy and provide the same in return, somewhat akin to a massage performed with one's tongue.
my response is as follows: (a) the majority of men have no affinity for seriously emaciated women.
you must cut your cousin and ex boyfriend off completely.
does his friends point at you when you are with him?
it is possible to enjoy giving pleasure instead of recieving it.
i keep thinking about being intimate with a girl.
it depends on if they are brunette or not.
is she simply trying to use you?
you can have a big penis and still be bad in bed.
get rid of the ex if you are dating a man you love right now.
it hurt extremely badly and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, and petting one another before sex.
when he does, you should explain to him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break-up.
my boyfriend loves me a lot and does not want to give me up.
you are already doing it, so why bother?
it was impressive on the hood of my car, at a waterfront, in a light rain.
i believe that you are likely a nice man, and she likely loves you a lot.
you are searching too hard or possibly looking in the wrong places; sign up for yahoo personals.
only if you desire it.
though if she does not have a reason then she is not your friend.
you need to find what is right for you and your partner(s).
you are definitely not a promiscuous woman, so do not worry.
girls to not think it is cool. they think that men who smoke are pathetic because they are killing themselves.
so, do you like asian food?
they do not mean to get them pregnant. however, they cannot keep it in their pants because they are pigs!
i like natural and real girls, not fake-looking, prissy drama queens.
take on how the world runs, and their desires to catch up to the ever expanding world.
that is too many, and selfish, you are desperate to try another one though, correct?
it is as if you decided to eat chocolate, and then complain about appearing overweight.
he loves you; you are aware of that?
my wife is a forgiving woman.
you order online and then the store brings it to you.
around three or four.
imagine that i am that man and be my girlfriend.
offer them the chance to discover you.
it is unusual, yes, but not bad.
i still love him. what should i do?
do not remain with him solely for the child.
never ignore her, always listen to her, and never change the subject. women really dislike that.
it can be good luck if that is the way that you want to look at it.
egotism is a man's attribute, you just have to live with it.
it sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
good luck but be sure to do your homework!
do not come here because it seems like it is a trap to me.
everywhere! just ask any girl passing by in thailand, but not in the united states.
this girl does not want a bad boy at all.
but i really need to be happy.
you are being dishonest by flirting with these pathetic desperately lonely men and you ought to be ashamed.
additionally, men sometimes think that they do not need you much until you are gone.
the only words i have are "good luck!"
you married your husband, i hope, because you love him.
i most enjoy expressing my feelings to women with poems. has anyone written one for their significant other?
why limit yourself to only one guy?
have you both agreed on doing this?
what is going to stop me when i have already done it?
he has to start over and earn your trust again.
i met his father in his side of the family.
we fell in love with them, and they treat us terribly, why?
i am one of those people who want to wait until they're in love with someone.
try to be nice first, women don't like being ignored.
you will hurt your loved ones if you continue to keep secrets.
some women like hairy men, some men like fat women, some women like skinny guys and vice-versa.
curves, especially if they have ample breasts and are soft. i cannot beat soft women.
never tell her she is fat.
you are a mother, please act like one.
others believe society dictates what others think, but i do not care.
i give them two months. they will get over you.
do not know, but daniel k has never read manga.
that is good, it is similar to getting your father's blessing.
i prefer intelligent, pleasant, and captivating women.
i will be your significant other is you come to me town.
this generation is not too bright.
you will have to pay the price.
they are very much in love.
every time i see an advertisement for malaysia air, i go crazy.
he asked me on a date in a very nice way.
try talking to her and asking her to hang out as friends. see if the relationship ends up going somewhere.
this is a very hard choice because there are many temptations.
not what you could become just because she says so.
both of you should speak privately and personally, you need to clear each other's side, do it now.
well, the one i enjoyed goes something like this.
do not attempt to experience sexual relations.
just stay calm, a bit of hard to get may help!
if you relationship lasts a year, i would assume you should be ready.
in any event, i married my husband, and wonder if you know the reasons in addition to love.
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who does not hate you.
you cannot, so let us operate on an assumption.
yes, we like flowers that are pretty and smell nice.
should i date him or not? it is a younger guy vs an older woman.
those other replies are cocky. i am a much better person.
lime green would be best for a summer wedding.
but let them marry, if they cannot exercise self-control.
i have the most terrible time sleeping, because my boyfriend snores!
you may not think so, but yes!
we have no room for messed up individuals like this in our society.
the best and easiest way is to fly, or drive, to las vegas, and get married there.
his answer is good enough for me.
no single man can give you what you want.
leave him if he does not start acting right.
if you are attractive you can show him your breasts.
a lot of men are like that and are just looking for sex.
(i make a lot of mistakes), but she does not forget.
unless you are desperate, wait for him to ask you out.
are you asking if i like you?
make sure it is your decision.
can you get someone to help her- her parents or friends?
how intoxicated what she?
women love men who are self confident.
i am doing this for some points.
if you don't know each other well, then there is no way you would connect.
i would say that is was real, and is worth having a relationship. good luck to you!
but if you are used to it and you enjoy it, then go along with it.
because it is buy one, take one.
and lastly, does he always happen to be staring?
it sounds false, but i swear, women enjoy it.
you have the unintelligent ones out there that think skinny is better.
however, i always believed the fact there is a huge difference between having sex and making love.
you have to make yourself walk away.
in my case, i think around _num_
i like it when they lean in, and give me a soft kiss on the forehead.
i can not see life without my husband.
it is prettier and smooth as silk.
flowers are nice, even if the do not last long.
it is sounding like he is having too much fun while you are away.
why do you not simply leave the girl alone?
maybe you should try dating girls, if guys offend you so much.
i also do not have a single girlfriend.
just remember: go for men who are themselves, and only themselves!
they feel that they are better than women, but they are wrong.
that does not mean that you should let them in.
it is always in the back of your mind.
her friend to talk with her on the phone?
getting married and having children can wait, our studies cannot.
you need to repeat this a few times.
the majority of males prefer females that enjoy sex.
don't look back. enjoy the acquaintances you currently have.
no greater good, nor bad is your own personal belief.
i'm unsure concerning what i should do.
agreed, it is an unhealthy behavior.
delay doing so until you reach age _num_ your appeal will not diminish in such time.
my eternally close friend despises my partner and hopes for the dissolution of our relationship, but it will not occur.
be authentic and restful. such behavior is that which we enjoy.
they should try taking our last names.
once you have children, you will need to decide on a last name.
he wants to continue.
i pick the domestic goddess.
ask her for another date after claess.
life is too short, so live it to the fullest and have faith.
as a man, i feel the same way because of who i am.
call him if you feel that level of attraction to him.
if you start with a basic question, you can go from there.
did you tell more people?
my friend want to kiss their boyfriends.
you can ask if you are a good kisser.
i am at your service anytime, we will not regret it.
you need to put it in again and add it back, just like the first time.
you can share this with your mom or dad.
and do not fall for the "alcoholic only on weekends" line that the guy is giving you.
you sort of put yourself out there to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
personally, i prefer a and b cups.
be her friend first, then observe where it goes.
do not even listen to what people, not merely males, state, but observe how they act.
do you feel in that manner?
alas, if a male inquires of you, do not be frightened to state negatively.
obviously, she does not desire you if you know she is partial towards the other male.
there are lots of things that make a woman dislike sexual intercourse.
not all men get bored and move on.
but there is no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
depending on what you are looking for, the relationship may be friendship only.
i did this with my current beau.
it does not mean that you cannot love another.
in my opinion, you should divorce that man, he has no honor and he does not love you.
basically, men just want a companion for unfettered copulation.
you will have to ask him for it again if nothing else works.
it is your personality and you need to keep it; whether a boy goes out with you or not should not determine how you act.
you have to look within yourself for the answer.
if the man is worthy enough, you will not need to.
i am confused and do not know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way.
shop around for invitations and anything else.
he then asked me "could i come with you?'.
just go with your feelings. if you like her so much, then go for it.
so, i am only myself around men i am not attracted to, and you know the outcome.
i hope you find a nice girl.
alright, i have been attracted to this girl since i was in the ninth grade.
to all of my fellow woman at cone: a big "hi!" and a hug!
if she's fond of him, a motivation exists.
if attending the cinema is exceptional for you as a couple, take part in that activity.
it simply appears that you don the trousers.
did you relay to her the annoying nature of her daily check-ins with you?
for that same reason that thin girls prefer boys who are slender and toned.
he handed his cellular phone to me and had me put my telephone number in it.
go to hawaii, or you could pay someone.
i do not understand why people think that it is wrong.
keep searching for someone who believes in romance, she is out there.
you need to be shot if you plan to cheat on your wife.
well, he already knows that you admire him. has he said anything about it?
confront ask him, and that way you will know.
i would say, that it is more of a trust issue.
continuously attempt to impress her.
because you are punished, you get no television for a month.
it is better than the one on top of me.
it did not matter as we are just friends.
you need to go to school. you can still come home or call you friends and family.
the one that pick on you usually likes you.
my views changed when i met my true love.
do you take baths? do you know how to speak?
i like him and he says he would date me if i was single.
discard him, it would be better.
it's the only time in your life, you're able to live out true love!
people had questioned me, why was i rushing?
has he discarded women with similarity before?
i'm thirty six currently. i'm still in therapy regarding it.
do not be one of those controlling mothers.
have you ever thought of that?
it has been six months, is it normal that i still like him?
look for a man that is handsome.
it is really sweet, just what you are looking for.
is there a reason why you are not with the babys father?
you are wasting your health, because girls do not like that.
i prefr a size c or d. anythign bigger is a waste.
i think they do.
do not be rude.
you should most likely look for someone in a public place where you feel most comfortable.
one time a guy asked me if i minded if we cuddled.
did you ask about the score of the last game?
some couples never get to the comfortable and boring stage.
i always state that you should not do things if you are going to regret them later on.
even the following day would be alright.
well, all you are missing is a smile worth a million dollars.
i hear you, fountain, something similar happened to me.
although, i do not really like girls all that much.
be really nice, give eye contact, and smile often. i hope this helps!
i wonder why he shaved them but in the end, they're his legs!
best of luck to both of you.
this is just why i have been hurt many times.
i prefer natural appearances, rather than a full face of makeup.
i prefer _num_ years younger, who wants to be with an older woman?
ask your friend if it will be okay with them.
many people will probably reject you.
downtown houston about every weekend because of the clubs.
who said women do not feel anything?
do not start with her looks, sir.
you also should move on if they have.
try flirting to see how he responds.
i am waiting until i am married, but when is it too far?
there is nothing wrong with her asking for your telephone number.
also, you do not nee to be an overly happy, hyperactive person.
i do not want to just randomly walk up and say "will you go out with me?".
then comes the fun part, him making it up to you.
give at least _num_ minutes for kissing and hugging and maybe some licking too.
i can't help any more unless i have more information.
because i say no on avatars.
some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them, something that lasts.
he is likely wondering if you are interested in him at all; flirt back with him.
i feel silly, nerdy, and happy.
if you are a whore, then he is also one; i personally do not think that you are one though.
there are some men who only say the "l word" if they mean it.
i do not need a trophy girl; i want a companion.
as a man, i may have some insight.
believe in yourself, be confident, don't act arrogantly, and always listen to what she is saying.
he asked if i would like to use his chapstick.
there isn't a proper way to kiss someone.
we do not think about things until later; and, this is because we love them.
i do not know as i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you took part in?
it is like getting rid of a drug habit.
speak to him, and it would not seem psychotic because you have known each other for some time.
definitely for the first answer, that girl answered for me.
or, what about the blue and green?
a life of your own..a life that you have been missing out on.
confusing, yeah, i believe you are right.
the deal is, you do not have to ask her to date to date her.
perhaps he is going to telephone you!
tell her, but be as polite as possible.
i lost my virginity in a park when i was sixteen years old.
what guy does not like big breasts?
you should be proud of yourself.
men work and fix things, but what else can you do?
we do not know what you look like!
if you could have four qualities in your woman, what would they be?
look online or check your local newspaper and you will find many things for the wedding.
if she sits on your best friend's lap because she is drunk, then yes that is a turn off.
should i see my boyfriend?
you will find a man who really deserves you one day.
well, you and that sexy perfume you wear.
if he isn't and you are still not ready, then screw him!
why do they want it state sanctioned?
she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons!
you need to move on, but you can still love him.
see if the guy you like is willing to go out of his way for you.
if anyone knows the answer, please let me know.
i never knew that life could be so great!
and he said he would call me back.
choose the one you like the most.
disable the pop-up blocker.
if you truely love him you will tell him.
who knows, but i would absolutely love for that to be done to me.
what should i do to have her?
sir, you have to deal with it and introduce yourself.
there are films that i have not seen yet.
i believe it is completely dependent upon age and upbringing.
and, that will be simply intercourse.
my male paramour was sincerely my friend first, and it is complete bliss.
what does it matter what anyone else believes?
also, try getting a few blonde highlights.
let it all out. i use art to vent problems.
if she enjoys music, make a special cd or tape for her.
it could be. choose one and explain why?
do not worry what other people say.
it is my opinion that a lot of women enjoy receiving flowers.
i cannot explain it but it does not have anything to do with them being young, vulnerable, or submissive.
either let him go or date his brother.
there absolutely are, you just have to look.
you can purchase them at staples for _num_
your child is going to have a difficult time growing up without a father.
my friend says i am too nice, and should tell them no.
my girlfriend always tells me that she loves me when we are passing notes during class, but not in a confrontational way.
that is correct, the right relationship happened on its own.
you will look quite foolish.
no, and you should not care. if you like him, then stay with him.
i think you should be yourself, have self-esteem, and self-confidence.
anything that is not nailed down.
make it your top priority to see her, if you really want to be with her that badly.
one of my best friends had a crush on my big sister a few months ago.
should i just let this go and move on?
their friends, on the other hand, are a different story.
yes, i do and i think anyone would.
my cousin went online and met some strange older pervert who said he was a sexy teen.
help me choose my neighbor's wife!
i have long black hair, i love it, and so does my husband.
you care about your family, and your family cares for you.
ugly men just go for any woman available.
in the middle of the river, there were lots of people watching!
eye contact is the key point.
it is really a matter of what the man is attracted to.
it gives us this feeling that you may not be strong enough.
he may love you, but he also may want to disappoint his father.
some men don't think of their partner when they just get to it.
maybe the skinny girl was a mean person and she wasn't.
doing that does sound rather feminine.
if you want to enjoy your time, consider checking out some night clubs, restaurants, or gyms.
there are many good women available. you just have to look in the right places.
everyone has to break up at some point.
you win some and you lose some. take it with a grain of salt and be more careful next time.
happy birthday to you.
i just need someone to help me figure this out.
pick the one that treats you better.
i like a sixth grade boy too!
if you end it, he may not be your companion, that is why i do not enter romantic relatinos with companions.
attempt to emphaszie yourself more often, but you have to do far more than simple eye contact.
do what is best for you and him.
poor teeth, horrible breath, and deplorable body odor.
nobody needs to know that!
if i have to ask then i will leave and end the relationship and move on with my life.
do not misunderstand me.
i asked if he still liked me and he said he did but did not act that way.
where am i going with this?
keep getting a younger and younger woman, men. as your woman gets older, get a new one.
you know that is if you do not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean that it is the right thing to do; it only makes us human.
this is a mistake that cannot be undone!
practice unwrapping starburst with your tongue, and then tying cherry stems with your tongue.
did you catch her looking at you?
i know three men with whom i could probably get away with doing that.
you should ask her out or tell you that you like or admire her.
if he is going to be an on and off partner, then i suggest that you break off ties for good.
if they do not, then you will have to continue with your life.
i have never attended it.
compliment her and ask for her name. do not behave strangely. act as though you are the most suave man in existence.
she calls him often.
how should i approach her so she does not think i am another guy hitting on her?
if you wait a little while before dating guys, you might enjoy it more.
it is not cool to act better then someone else.
you do not have to make a decision about what to do.
why should i hide it?
some men do not like to dance.
truly, she is not your friend, because she will not stop annoying you.
i wish i had listened to my friends.
after how much time you can conclude that it takes too long, and she is not really interested?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
that is a no-brainer, and nice picture of george clooney on your profile.
some women cannot seem to find men their own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that was not too big.
it sounds like both of you are comfortable with the ways things are.
yes, it looks extremely beautiful on almost any woman.
sometimes it is better to be very good friends first to make sure that you will be happy around each other.
my question is, "will i always feel that way?"
a tremendous example would be faith hill's, "love ain't like that."
don't ask that question, if you don't want your feelings to be hurt.
she should be accepting of all your many facets if she loves you.
i think it is really attractive when a man shaves his legs.
if you two still keep in touch, i think you should maybe cease contact.
i like austin and asked my friend claudia to see if he likes me.
you are hurting the romance by asking that question. you should just focus on having fun together.
trust me, he is a player and no good.
it depends on the person. they like different kinds of people, but not those who are self-centered, like you are.
that is fantastic news! maybe you should act in the first movie.
should he refuse your request, his value is too low to begin with.
well, simply approach her.
it's a beneficial notion to consistently practice honesty...not to mention, the majority of men i'm familiar with don't mind being referred to as attractive.
they're aware the females will not pursue them like they will attractive or moneyed men who land a slew of women.
just face him and ask whether he would like to see a film.
that is why it is called making love.
he will know if you smile at him once in a while.
most girls are polite, and if she is, she will answer it.
i would because you resemble a close friend of mine.
hello, when shall we have dinner together?
i think most men do not care, but it does depend on the individual person.
it will work out if you want it to.
give up if he does not want to dance.
i believe that the man should take the first initiative in a relationship.
if you do not have a boyfriend it would make you seem easy.
take advice from a military girl and wait.
you can never tell, they never show affection unless there is something that they want.
i am forty-nine years of age and am looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly more.
do you mean to seem more sexy?
go to 'deleted items', it should be there.
i wonder if this is a red flag of who this man truly is.
perhaps because your name is freakgirl. if you show your face, then maybe not. no hard feelings.
i have been there and done that. trust me, that is going to be extremely painful.
do you love her deeply?
you can ask that question to your cell mate.
you can only see a man get emotional when he is with his lady love.
i have done it, and it was a lot of fun.
you have to let the person know who you are and what you want.
i would be crazy if she called me _num_ times a day.
hang on there for one that appreciates you.
my mom books them all of the time through the email:pat@alanatvl.com
besides don't you think he has enough to worry about?
i have been in a relationship with a man who is younger than me.
men pretend to love in order to have intercourse; women pretend to enjoy intercourse in order to get love.
it must become annoying after a time.
everybody enjoys being called attractive, even if they will not admit it.
yes, but it depends on the man.
perhaps because you simply think they are sexually attractive when they run on the field.
you are too young to be speaking of kissing already.
i will most likely inform her soon because she is my best friend. in any case, any help would be appreciated.
i agree with the other person before anyone comes to harm.
i am ready to move on but i love him to much to do so.
go out and do all of the things that you could not when you were with him or her.
it is apparent that men are not much better.
perhaps you could inform him that you simply want to be friends with benefits.
try playing, "truth or dare," together.
he sounds like he is a manipulative simpleton.
you should try foreplay, it slows down the pace.
death is similar to a large black bag, full of drugs.
where do you live? i could come over and you could practice kissing me.
no, you won't get hurt. i was married to a complete jerk!
it sounds like you really love her, so there is no need to forget her.
tell him that you want to be friends, and that you are very disappointed that he would act the way he did.
don't do things you do not want others to know about. things always end up becoming public.
and why does chest hair exist?
as for now, i believe he is angry, hurt, upset, and no longer interested in you.
give your brother some money and tell him to leave.
no offense, but it sounds like a woman's name, but i mean no disrespect.
ask her on a date.
take her out and get to know her, and the nask her out.
people do not like their emotions played with.
practice by unwrapping starburst wrappers with your tongue.
i only want points.
that is not entirely true. it is simply that most girls are discreet about it.
that is dependent on whether you are physically attractive.
i informed him that it was too late. other than that, i would not mind receiving flowers at times.
"believe in" is a strange way to phrase it.
why can men (or boys in your case) not ever say the word "love"?
enjoy the age you are now, and do not worry about this.
i am _num_, and i like anyone up to _num_
i had a friend in the same situation.
females are as dirty minded, trust me.
you should not go out with a man because you "need" to.
so what you are saying is that she does not want to be more than boyfriend and girlfriend?
is it usually about a year, before both people begin to feel that comfortable, commonplace stage?
probably, because i knew that all of my girlfriends were not truly, "the one," until i met my wife.
in my opinion, as long as you do not base your relationship on lovemaking, then it is okay.
why would some men do that?
if you are the real man, then breast size should not matter.
avoid men who can't be open about their feelings.
ask for permission, and watch how fast she rejects you.
my husband likes my personality.
my mother has cancer as well, this is too personal for me.
be your best self, if he is impressed or likes you, then he will talk back.
you do not ever want anyone else but that person.
why do you not try talking to and even seeing other men, just to see his reaction.
it is okay to kiss on the first date.
men have an issue with secrets.
i had someone get quite rude with me because i was still seeing people?
so, how do i just kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister and i desire for it to be perfect!
unless it is with the inappropriate man.
what does it matter if it is a rebound relationship for you both?
i wish you luck in your search for "the one".
why is it that everyone seems to want someone that they can not have and know that they should not want?
are you someone who enjoys arguing and fighting?
if you are set on that, then that is the way to go.
i dated someone for _num_ years and they cheated on me.
work on your relationship, but do not let him keep you locked up at home.
ask him how he is once in a while.
men get bored before women do.
she is strong and loving and most of all really was not as happy as she seemed to be.
it is one way of saying that you do not like them.
king had a song about this:"only your mother loves you (and she might be jiving, too)".
he loves you too and time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone, to whom i come home.
did it feel good? because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful.
you want all of your friendships to last forever?
it does not mean that you are loose.
i am going to a club and dancing.
do not go anywhere you went with him or her.
they are tons of fun and plenty to do.
it depends on when you are ready.
stay _num_ miles away from the man.
be prepared, because if it happens once, it can happen again.
i am looking for a girl who wants to spend time with me.
he will get another girlfriend.
my wife does not like to wear those brands.
you should break up and keep yourself open to other options.
why do homosexuals look to marriage?
avoid being weak by not saying sorry for something you did not do.
take time to decide.
they do not respect your feelings.
no, seriously, think about the number of arrogant girls that are out there.
she is too scared to ask him to go out.
get a hold of yourself, how could you love a person that you do not even speak to?
i would ask you to go out, but i live in oregon and i have no idea where you live.
they have not performed previously and the pleasure is twice as nice!
i will most likely go and see.
ether way, i wish you the best, and i am happy that i have brown hair.
send me a picture of you, and i will let you know.
it is just a challenge.
i am a girl, so i can give you some advice.
don't tell them but let them find out once you are in bed with her.
if i would've kept my last name its just freakin name.
i hardly ever see him in school. i usually see him with my brothers playing basketball.
he is telling that to some girls too because he is a womanizer.
you need to leave him; there are plenty of people to find while looking for love.
i am aware because i am just like your wife.
when she calls you, send her a text message back.
no chance, i am five feet four inches tall and he is six feet two inches tall.
do you not know that the number one rule is to trust no one?
we have tried breaking up a couple of times but it never happens.
oh and some because they are thin and skinny, and these days anorexic girls are a turn on.
if you have a penis then it is no problem; you just have to penetrate her vagina with your erect penis.
in that case, take some self defense classes.
i just got out of a three year relationship with my baby's father.
what happened when the politician took viagra?
hello, my name is "xxxxxx" and it has been working for me for years.
i am only able to say that women are complicated.
we like a soft approach and a little bit of pursuing.
you really would be surprised by the types of people who go to them.
when you meet each other after texting for a few months, it can be very enjoyable.
hello, i am in new york city, i will help you out if you are available.
it sounds strange, but it worked for me, in about three to five days.
do not worry, i am not working with much either.
if they do not get along, then they should not spend time together. why does it matter what they think?
if he is, then you have a good man.
if he likes you, you will know it!
i guess it is normal but i would just move on.
the rest is easy from there.
i like any guy that has a sense of humor.
you are the only one who can make this decision.
why did you ask this question?
don't just spill everything because you think it is right.
a ten year age gap is nice.
if he still does not enjoy your company, move on.
okay, i see him every week in psr, but i just cannot speak to him!
because they do not fell secure with uneducated men...
for one thing, if it does not work out, you lose your employment.
i hope to the creator it does not ever pass!
only the ones that are not worth your time.
smaller of course and it is all about attractiveness.
you all do not have any excuse to dislike each other.
if you do not you will always wonder.
some people choose not to because of their religion and others do not.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it will be harder to be friends.
i wish you the best of luck.
that was men who were not ready to commit.
this is a big day for both of you, don't be so rash in you decisions.
i am _num_ years old, and am still living with my mother, why is that wrong?
i have a man willing to move _num_ miles to be with me.
i must not be hideous then.
that is okay, i am generous.
it depends on the woman and what she wants.
remember that it takes two, not only one.
if he really liked you instead of her, he would have broken-up with her to be with you already.
stay around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
please do not miss out on this one.
because, believe it or not, women dislike men with big egos.
you should stick with what you feel inside.
sadly it happened to me twice.
i do not know, perhaps you are young.
regardless of what he says, actions speak louder than words.
there is nothing in the world like an obese woman.
do not sell yourself, even if he is wealthy.
i am a thirty-year-old homosexual man who recently moved to sacramento.
the people who are near you now, such as your friends, should like you no matter what.
because they like the small breasts and genitalia.
you should wait until you are both older and if you still feel the same way then pursue it.
yes, although i am not one of those persons, i do know that there are a lot of them.
no, not if you need to ask.
you want to have oral sex with another man?
because they are girls and they are less sophisticated than we are.
does this mean that he is interested in me?
don't worry about him, concentrate on your classes, and you boyfriend.
i dated someone like this, so i understand.
see the way that she walks.
no (at least i am hoping not).
hello, i desire to visit your country.
over time, should i allow him another chance?
the same man you desire to be in a relationship with?
i went and he was there.
why did you call it that?
that way you can still go by your last name.
both of you have to work hard to get it correct.
i did tell her that i like her and she said that she liked me also.
you can join a community website with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your nude infant photographs.
it is very important to last between thirty and forty-five minutes.
but i am telling you to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then attack him.
i love curly hair. i like to run my fingers through it.
i want my wife to grow up, too.
well, that is the way it is, i suppose.
one girl, michelle, who likely would not mind being named, spot up and said she did not believe in it.
i can toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash.
however, he was a little busy afterward.
she knows how much i care about him, so i do not know what to do.
just quit if you do eat something like that.
it could be that you need to use the restroom, or perhaps the last dream you had was the cause.
you know, if he wants to wear my pants, then all he has to do is ask me. sheesh!
if you were friends before and have stronger feelings now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangement you would like and flowers.
lie, and then lie some more.
wait until you find out and confirm, then go from there.
if you two are at dance class, it shouldn't matter.
trust him, and don't bring the topic up again.
most women are waiting for a man to tell her what he truly feels.
i would love to meet more women.
i actually think about this occasionally.
i became acquainted with a gentleman one time, romance galore. we first met amidst this incredible rainstorm.
all right, presently certain men like women of that type and others, not as much.
it takes place subsequent to "threeplay" and prior to "fiveplay."
on occasion i'm in a romance with someone, i suffer embarrassment.
should a query be required, the message is that i've not fallen in love.
if you feel it comming on, start the foreplay again.
i do not understand. can someone please give me the answer?
it was no hastle to save _num_ doing my own flowers.
i got divorced, and so did he.
ask a woman about the symptoms, because i am male.
women enjoy a little toughness, or most of them do. but mostly, be yourself.
follow your heart because it is never wrong.
they bother you all day.
see if he calls, or if he emails you to see if he cares.
you can perform a citizen's arrest.
usually a back spasm.
by now, you may love your wife for everything the two of you have endured.
good luck. i hope everything goes well.
say, "i love you" and if they hesitate to say it back, that says everything.
attempt once again to invite her on a date and evaluate her response.
no method exists for forcing a person to feel romantically towards you.
pose queries to her (avoid simply conversing).
upon iniitially discovering romantic love, you feel elated, delighted, and joyful simply ruminating on that individual.
also, don't forget that an excess of just one exists!
i personally think that they look better than a lot of the other nations out there.
all-in-all, i do not believe that it really matters.
i would not drive for five hours just to spend time with someone unless i really liked her a lot.
how often could you have sex with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her, and am being sincere about my love.
think about how wonderful it was.
i am a person that doesn't want to harm another soul.
give out a rose and express your love.
i like them thick because i feel cheated with a thin one!
remember, the vow is until death do you part!
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life.
i have no idea what you are trying to say.
if you continue speaking to him for another week, he may start to think he is married to you.
women do no want too much other than to be acknowledged and helped at times.
at least that is what it seems like to me.
don't be afraid to say no.
dump him, there are always more fishes in the sea.
to me, it really doesn't matter but a hand full is white enough for me.
choose the one that adores you the most.
you still released at least one thousand.
you visit a bar and drink until you are inebriated.
give it time and thought.
no, you shouldn't leave them, just teach them how to better please you.
bembie reached the proper conclusion.
no, you two should kiss when you are ready.
jules sac is funny but he is mean also.
if you are asking this, then you must have already distanced yourself from her and remained her friend at the same time.
do not forget to decide and vote for the best answer!
do not attempt to figure it out, that is just the way that it is.
i do not know, but i have knowledge of another webpage that i visit..
okay, it depends on how deeply you are starting to experience emotions for this boy!
he has to be very controlling.
it all depends on how interested the girl is in getting with the man in question.
try and go outside to meet new people.
usually it is more than just one thing.
that is if you truly adore them.
men: do you prefer a larger or a smaller woman?
if your only interaction is argumentative, it is not worth it.
the worst part is, i already dated him for four years.
you simply must be patient and the correct young woman will arrive.
unless you do not love your husband any longer and have room in your life for another man.
wife, because then you can do more without committing a sin.
she does want you to think she is attractive, but she does not want that to be the most important reason.
it depends. some days i want to have intercourse, others i do not.
also, they are more passionate during intercourse.
if you play with both at the same time, she will probably give you great sex.
it is because he would not work, hit me, used guilt trips on me, was a big mama's boy, and so on.
maybe it is because you are the most beautiful girl they have ever seen.
it really depends on whether someone is vain or not.
i want someone i can be myself with.
can you send me a picture of you and contact me?
you need to stay away from your guy friend.
the doctor does not believe it.
i do not like it when she throws up.
if not, don't concern yourself.
i could assist you with some details.
if it feels as if your love is fading, don't ignore it.
i will not be in a relationship with an individual i do not have confidence in.
i only told a woman that i loved her once, and i meant it.
you married him for a reason.
tear your shirt off and yell as tarzan does.
yes, woman down there, do not have intercourse.
they accept this in their culture.
always go trail riding with company.
you didn't give us very useful information, where do all of you live?
move on, who cares if he is attractive.
you just need to be yourself.
yes, you should be disappointed and exasperated.
i apologize, but i have never felt that way.
i sure would not like any woman who would make my life difficult.
if he gets them first, then you get the popcorn.
let's practice. ask me if i am doing good.
if you are sure, however, then you should tell your parents is you have not already done so.
i met mine in a carnival.
are you posing a rhetorical question?
i am of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name.
your first kiss, however, should be heavenly.
nothing good will happen at that place.
here is the best way to make a woman happy.
my advice is to not do things that can allow you to get hurt.
you will absolutely make more money if you work hard.
please do not approach her and tell her how nice she looks.
i do not think it is a good idea, because you are not there for that purpose.
ask her if she is single.
he would make a great valentine.
be ready to let her go.
do not sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one.
just tell them. what are they going to do? slap you?
get a massage, and get away from it all.
well, if you are really attracted to this guy, then smile and speak nicely to him.
take them both out at the same time.
it happened to me, and now i am dating that person.
it is easy to make friends.
you might be overlooking the type of men who like you.
you should find someone who does not hate you.
we tried to move on, but it did not work.
when will people in this deranged world realize this?
i would not bother with calling him back.
attempt to avoid him and find another man.
search for another attractive woman in order to make her jealous.
in my opinion, you are not promiscuous.
red stands for love, black stands for death, and so on.
if she likes him then she does not like you so let her go because it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, i could start to forget about you once three days have passed.
find a talented girl who is also pretty.
there is no one you can trust more than a good friend.
begin the day with breakfast, then perhaps a nice walk.
pick then up then, is she yes.
if the answer is ye, then why do i hear many girl stating flowers will not last?
it may be that it is interesting for them.
will it ever return back to normal?
it isn't so bad, at least it isn't bella.
is it because some men are liars?
you could confess to her and have a fairytale-like romance.
finally, a culture that ho as it right.
my twin will not talk or listen to me.
you want to get something you can not get rid of, go ahead.
only i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
if you are talking ten, then i believe it would be find to get a video or computer game.
go for it, take the chance.
if he does not know how to dance, then take him somewhere with slow-dances, like a dinner date.
in a family life, this is the most beautiful.
it is your choice not to dislike one, i despise them all, to say the least.
never get married without a prenuptial agreement.
get a life and do not waste mine.
is she saying you are too good for her?
guys will come and go, but friends will be friends forever.
it could mean a variety of things.
yes, it is normal. there are plenty of people who are still attracted to someone they broke up with.
i would like to see what a black female has to say about this.
men are stupid! who knows why they do what they do?
well, you do not have to wait at all, if they give you their phone number.
because we are all masters of the universe.
i am in love and do not care who knows it.
do not try to have both of them at once, whatever you do.
you would not be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
it is ok to be friends with someone online, but there should be limits.
my sister closes her eyes to get ready when she kisses someone.
i personally would not marry a woman who did not want to change her name, but that is just me.
just a small party for the family.
girls are perverts; they just hide it and act like perverts around other girls secretly.
and i am only in fifth grade.
you do what you want.
refrain from that course of action, it will not be successful.
should they fail to do so, the moment has arrived to continue apace.
he possessed all the qualities i desired, with his attractiveness, wealth, and other factors.
correct, also it is a portender of misfortune to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
no, she is not a liar.
be quiet and be a homosexual if you choose to.
he also had his nose pierced.
yes, i can lift him, he only weights _num_ pounds.
you need to speak to a therapist.
some perverted men fetishize young looking asian women.
you should speak to a therapist.
giving you a vapid excuse, and acting differently from before.
be strong, and don't lose hope.
no, he is too big and i am too weak
i find it unattractive if she is so drunk she becomes loose.
exchange letters, e-mails, chat online or over the phone, send packages, just keep in touch!
most definitely on those occasions when you have no desire to do so.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores: two points.
sacrificing it simply to maintain his presence in your life is akin to making a deal with the devil for your immortal soul.
i'm unable to offer a wife-based opinion, however, i'm hoping my assessment is equally valuable.
and it eases the pressure i'm feeling to invite somebody.
it is the woman's decision.
ask in english, no one here understands you.
i am a man, and i can give you some insight.
i like him so much, and i want to be with him.
i like this man very much, and i do not know if he feels the same way.
by the way, your avatar looks familiar.
it has been more than six months, and i cannot seem to get over it.
perhaps he believes that he will be denied; just ask him, which is what i would do.
i suggest that you consider that point, and it should be helpful in determining whether you can trust him.
a picture of the two of you, the shape of a heart, from when you were first dating. that is special.
i am in college, and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
it isn't so easy. i got together with my ex-boyfriend in second grade, then in fourth grade, and again in eighth grade.
i have been in a relationship with this girl for _num_ months, and we have not yet kissed. is this bad?
some men aren't at all attracted to breasts.
she only wants to see other people?
we have seen each other, everyday, for approximately four to five years.
that was his destination, so he got off of the train.
the worst that could happen is that she says no.
i know what i want in a relationship.
he might ask you on a date if you flirt, and send flowers and candies to myself.
i do not like seeing my dad unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i snore sometimes. most people do, right?
i like s.o.s and need to know if i'm in love.
if you guys truly love each other then you can work out all the fighting.
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits.
however that doesn't mean that big girls can't be cute.
but he is getting married this month.
but those guys are mean and you do not want them anyway.
say will you go out with me?
and get married only after you have been with a guy for more than _num_ years.
men have a penis and women have a clitoris.
separate the bad thing and move on.
it would be easier to do if i were furious.
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america.
you should get to know her and eventually you or her will ask each other out.
as i said, he already knows you like him, so just take a deep breath and ask him.
perhaps you and i can get together some time and we will fall in love with each other.
i would be, but i just got married!
play the field for a bit right now.
i agree with everyone else, don't marry too early.
have you been to the doctor yet?
pay attention to what everyone else is saying.
just talk to your spouse about this.
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
i was thinking about picking a medium pink color, but what should it go with?
ask if they want to go somewhere with you.
a trip to a amusement park such as a roller coaster or even a theatrical museum are fun.
do men truly prefer bigger women?
the problem is that i truly like him.
i would say they do work out, not a of the times, but i hope this helps.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i did it before, accidentally, and my friend was mad that i deleted him.
i do not believe i mind, either way.
that is her way. you could try it that way or you could keep your eyes open.
some do that, but you should be able to tell.
are you talking about your avatar?
i do not remember giving a woman a christmas gift, unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself and do not show off.
just take it day-by-day and step-by step to figure out how he lost a good thing.
the world would be happier if men knew what women want.
make it an honest compliment about her.
i think she will hurt him.
it means she is interested in the guy.
i am thinking you might get harmed.
we are now only just divorced.
if the suggest a salacious photo, they would like to have intercourse.
at least she didn't give you a fake number.
tell her to move to massachusetts.
you should not get married if you feel this strongly about it.
i would pick maui or the bahamas.
the guy that i like is mad at me.
do not worry, you are only _num_
try this which will result in you not worrying about the appropriate amount of calls to him.
as a guy, i can say, we men love to chase women.
thanks for the talk.
we tend to push away the ones that we love.
they believe that they can control the lives of others when they cannot.
that is strange but i do not know. i will talk with my friend by his locker.
i do not know. how would you like to have something pushed up your anus?
if a man cares, then he calls.
what is a special gift i can give to my brother-in-law on his birthday?
he probably isn't interested either.
hold her hands, look in to her eyes, and tell her everything you've wanted to say.
some men do, and some men do not.
i would very much like to know, so please help me.
the timing was not right with the former man, you will see.
generally kind and my fifth. i will only be disappointed if she is unintelligent.
it is one of the presents which we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe that trust needs to be earned because how is that even possible to do?
if that is you, then you definitely need to stop because it is nasty.
do not let her rule your life, she will need to learn how to cope with it.
i have yahoo email and that works fine for me.
i would not worry too much about that.
yes, that trickster has never had a chance.
it is a good sign when you can fart in front of the person you are dating.
that depends on the person's age.
any man who says he would, is likely not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, the challenge is not there.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you may have some issues.
she should be _num_ to _num_ she does not have to be younger than you.
maybe she does not love you, but try to use your brain and not your heart.
do not let her know that want to be with her forever and you probably stand a better chance of that being the way that it is.
there a lot of inexpensive ideas out there, you need to find what you like and work with it.
if you are worried about it performance wise, you should not.
find another girl if that does not work, move back
almost without exception (not constantly) those are men similar in age to yourself, more or less.
if your behavior is always as it is now, she may come to believe you're in a state of desperation.
not every participant present is attending educational courses.
advise him of your genuine desires. that's the information relayed, but an action not attempted. make comments.
shall i take the initial action or shall i bide my time until he takes the initial action?
you have set up a double standard.
after a while, you do not see the color.
i am trying to get the nerve to ask her on a date.
if you two are serious, then if you ask her that question, if should not bother her.
why do you want to ask her out?
would you like to go on a date with me?
let me know if you are ever in flordia.
those were some wonderful times.
it is all about her, and that isn't what should happen on a first date.
do you really want to get married to someone you constantly argue with?
if he has come to his senses, then that is wonderful.
you are too good for them.
get the upper hand because she like him.
depending on the age, compact disc or digital video discs.
start from the beginning and then work your way to _num_ years down the road.
i would like to visit the united states. what are important items to bring?
anyone who has any ideas, tips, or general information, please send me an e-mail.
you sound live a very lovely person, so do not allow these women to make you feel bad.
you do not search. go outside, enjoy yourself, and a girlfriend will come along.
do not pursue it. he is getting married.
is it like clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
if the country you are in has a short messaging system in your cellphone then find a texting friend.
when she starts closing her eyes, kiss her on the lips and then it is up to you.
please be honest with me because i can handle the truth.
have fun and remember to never get so comfortable that you always know what is going to happen next.
it demonstrates how much they care about you.
let her know that you miss her and love her.
coffee; lunch; site-seeing; walk, talk or play in the park; visit a museum; go to a movie matinee.
what you want is a prostitute. you can locate one in any part of the world.
however, now we do all of these activities together and i do not know what to do.
because if it fails, you will be in trouble.
and it has been the best thing for me.
try using these, but only if they apply!
the problem is that he recently cheated, and it was very damaging.
if you are happy, she should be happy. unless she is toxic to the relationship.
we like when men do things for us and think about us.
perhaps if you allow him to be alone for a time, then he will call you back.
tell him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you are strange-looking and you stare, then they will think you are leering.
i don't know if he loves you, but i am positive he is interested in you.
if a man really respects you, he will understand you.
reflect on you actions and then decide. if you are capable of affording it, do what you would like.
he is the only superhero that is relatable to an average joe.
sometimes a little struggle is worth it in the end. the good will always outweigh the bad.
i do not think that it is wise to date people that you work with.
dunce, you need a theory class for that.
let it take its course from there.
i asked them what they think about gay marriage and relationships.
of course, i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
men will believe you to be attractive no matter what, usually.
but i do not believe that he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of intercourse.
the safest rules of internet dating are to chat via email, messenger, and phone.
marriage is about trust and communication.
i also had this problem.
it depends on who you kissed.
it depends on whether you can trust him at all.
just get your point across to her and make sure that you do not make her abhor you.
where have you been meeting these women from the philippines.
try to imagine that it was considered love.
that way you aren't exactly telling them what you specifically don't like about them.
if he is then go for it.
see if she's open for a dinner and a movie.
hey, i'm sorry. i don't know and i wish the best of luck to both of you.
however, i find him looking at me every now and then.
we have started our own sins.
for me, fun includes eating meals.
make a nice move, and if there is no responce, she is not interested.
let him make the first move, because if you do it might look like you are obsessed with him.
you should not get married.
my tragic love story was that we both loved each other very much.
you seem desperate, and you will never find one if you are desperate.
but he swears that we are merely friends.
appearance is not important unless you are attempting to prove something.
i realize that once you have sex with him, he no longer remains a good friend.
from my perspective, when a man is very self centered, i find that it makes him far less appealing.
you should take your time and feel all your emotions come to life.
it is a two way street; until you get them, you will know which one it is.
you have one child out of wedlock.
i realize i am overly selective when it comes to people; how can i stop this?
it hurts a good deal; perhaps some young women might say that is it?
i am going to surprise that young man; is that the correct choice?
it was a good idea.
if she gets drunk, then it is not a turn off.
some women send men minuscule messages without saying it clearly.
i would prefer if they left me alone. i apologize for going off topic.
ask her to go do something she is interested in, or see a movie she would like.
i use the term "man" very lightly when describing you.
it is too bad that it is not automatic such as msn or aol are.
that is how they will react to it, so yes it is a bad situation for you both.
you should go back to that person as soon as you can, before it becomes too late.
i also would like to slap that smile off of her face.
ask him if he would like to dance with you.
she might say that a different color looks better.
ask him to see a doctor.
i never went on a second date with him.
why did you break up?
go ahead and do it.
if he does not mind, no one elses opinion matters.
i am still in love with him.
i do not want to have sex again.
the most important issue, is not attempt to retaliate at the individual that wronged you.
if it's necessary to question other people, i do not believe that your ready.
i'm a female, i state things such as that.
a great savings area are flowers.
time will tell. in six months, we'll see what occurs.
you may be the only one with whom he can have sex.
from the list you have provided, i would select spiderman.
i was the victim of cheating for three of those years.
it seems that all of the male senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which unfortunate.
if he say's yes then you can tell him.
impress her with affection and love.
if you have, what was it like?
celebrate valentines day with joy and fun, give each other gifts and have fun.
any women sitting next to the beastly men, will be salacious.
when i moved in, my neighbor asked me out.
he is obviously shy, perhaps you should make a move.
on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
be yourself and say, "what is up?" you just might get a response.
many times you have loved a man, but were not sure if he loved you back.
if you are talking about a husband, or something similar, then i would say tools, toys for his vehicle, and sports related things.
that really stimulated me sexually, but i ran away.
as for me, i will pick up the tab if i can get your vote for "best answer".
alright, so what do you think is the most desirable breast size according to the average male?
many women _num_-years-old date men that are _num_ so, the _num_-year-old man feels insecure and have to fish downstream.
lust is less than like. did you recently go out?
they likely know you cannot hide that bug you should tell you parents.
i will make you a princess on the planet krypton.
my last girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her, before we met. she still kept dating him.
my friend is in a relationship with someone online.
do you enjoy fake nails or manicured ones?
tell her, women enjoy hearing the truth. best of luck to you.
we can wrestle and be best friends.
you need to remain faithful to your husband. he is the one the you swore vows to.
do not listen to these fools with all of their nonsense.
yes i am a male, therefore i do not really have to pay.
remember, no bird ever flew on only one wing.
just let her know how you feel.
it can depend; if you really love him then you may think that you want to elongate it.
if you or the other person are married, you need to quickly leave.
no, men do not however little boys do.
please help me to win this debate with her.
my girlfriend it very silly but i love her anyway.
simple enough, play with it, like everyone else does.
sweetheart, let him go, and if he is meant to be with you, he will come back to you.
of course, my back went out after the third straight day of that.
stay alive, and try to get your old life back.
that is why i asked why men don't know what they want in a relationship?
maybe ask him out for lunch or a movie?
girls don't like boys who only think of themselves.
do you like either of them?
i was always looking. i kept choosing men that were not kind.
no, i feel it is a choice. one does what one feels comfortable to them.
some do, some do not have it in them.
do what makes you happy.
for some reason, i cannot.
so it would have to be love.
because you know to try and search for your love, but be careful.
do not ask her to perform some act for you; make her the spotlight instead.
girls are simply impressed if you can show a little care, respect, and honesty to them.
tell the bad man to leave.
they think it is the only correct way.
i hope you stay calm and wish you luck.
you need to decide for yourself if you want to stay married to him.
i dislike him because of the way he acted.
if you do not obey men like this, they typically become the sort who beat their wives.
i have four children. a homemaker is more work than my occupation even.
no, i haven't. i prefer average looking men.
it definitely appears as if he has feelings for you. do you show him how you feel?
people overall make their decisions quickly currently.
i have a issue with unloading all my past in the beginning. perhaps, i imparted too much on him.
the right date can save money on many things.
if you truly love your boyfriend and want it to work it out, then tell your ex boyfriend to respect that.
it only makes her easier to seduce.
i do not think you should attempt it.
honesty and love, and try to be honest with them.
i was hoping for at least a _num_, but realistically, i think it was more like _num_ or _num_
cuddling with a large woman is one of the best feelings i know.
women also expect men to act like that, so why should they grow up?
it happens a couple of ways. get him drunk.
the problem is not if you ask her while at work or not.
stick with the boys who are either thirteen or fourteen.
do not let a man mistreat you.
i do not like having stay at home "romantic dinners."
when i left him, i promiced myself i would never get married again.
to not use pick up lines, just be yourself and compliment her.
you will be fine, have fun.
some men shave, it depends on the woman.
i still love him, but i believe that i am ready to move on and meet new men.
wait for another four years.
i hope that i see some of it very soon.
i do not want to be mean.
also, you should wait awhile before having children.
i would like to have some fun with you. that is why i answered the question.
try to contact their question and answer team. they will help you through, have a nice day.
women are not easy to get into bed.
if he insists, it means he is only after sex.
it definitely matters. anyone saying they do not, is likely lying.
while having intercourse is similar to a fantasy.
when you are eighteen or twenty years old, because when they said something, they did not mean it.
try to make it yourself whenever possible.
but, because there is always an exception, is there not?
if she is no longer interested in you.
i really doubt that you are in love with all of those men.
on average, i would say about _num_ percent at first, but it is perhaps _num_ percent once you get to know the person.
play sports with your male friends.
she will tell you if it is not okay with her.
i am not asking whether you think women are sexy and beautiful.
how do i get him to stop nagging me and leave me alone?
try a sex toy, that way, you both can enjoy it.
men without hari look like itttle boys, it is not attractive to me.
if you kiss him, her will respong one way or the other.
can you imagine yourself without him/her?
here, in america, it is not so important.
well, obviously, if it was before you, then he was not cheating at all.
i wonder how many times i passed up a great opportunity by worrying that someone would say, "no."
the caucasian women are taking up all the men.
also, your self-image is very important.
have you had a pap smear?
how old are you?
i think they both like me.
it sounds like you two are already married.
jamie is going to ask rubi out on a date.
that is a signal. such things can make it very obvious.
you should take time to get to know them both equally without going on dates with them.
i would appreciate logical opinions on this. thank you.
if you are interested in the man, then attempt it.
enjoying yourself with male friends is fine.
so, it is natural with that man.
women take on very much and at times, they feel like they do it for no reason.
no, because i am not yet married.
let me know what your thoughts are, thank you.
if you are gay then be gay!
good luck and hang tight.
i think it is wrong that they cannot go out with her.
what does everyone think?
i met my last boyfriend while i was driving in a roundabout.
because if you do, you are going to lose your friend over a man!
it was really casual with i said it, i did not think he would remember.
are you a country girl or a city girl?
spend the day together, and to top it off touch his feet.
i am bored of being single. i can only sit back any watch as other girls have all the fun!
women, including myself, are curious about sex with other women.
i was too lazy to read your typing, so i do not know what it was that you said.
i dislike it myself; i love the straight ones.
i am doctor izzy. i love and adore larger women.
there are no words that will make it better.
do it before it is too late.
honestly, you will learn but you must actually do it.
navy pier is a good place or one of the museums. there are many good restaurants or hotels.
i am not a country girl by the way but that is a stereotype and i think i am sexy in my own way.
he will not turn you down.
well, i hope you read this very well.
lots of men, especially black men, like women who are slightly heavy.
if she is interested she will call later
no you will not because you know he has a tendency to cheat.
as yourself that if you know what i mean.
i find if i try really hard, i can see things that i know are not normally there.
how about we get some coffee, chat and take it from there.
just move on with your life and find someone else.
i will bet you are not, but if you try to email me at thickchix@yahoo.com i will be honest.
me and this man have been dating on and off since last year.
i really care about you and i cannot stop thinking about you.
it is worth the wait when you are ready.
if you do not know you should ask someone who would.
repel your fear and inform him.
that is a risk you will have to take.
therefore, if you want to be attractive to people who are unsuccessful, strange, and perverse then you ought to drink heavily.
not for anything other than the appearance.
even though time has passed, i still love him.
it is your own life, make your own decisions.
even though i am getting divorced, i am still stuck with this.
just because he has potential to be a decent boyfriend, does not mean that he will be.
of course, let me get to know you more.
one minuite you might be fighting, the other you might feel passion for them.
i like girls that are pretty or have a great personality.
people whose parents take care of them are lazy.
i do not know what she wants.
it is complicated. can you tell me in a simple way?
show her what you are good at.
can you imagine him as the father of your children?
if you do not ask, someone else just might.
that is why i am single.
if you really loved him you would let him go.
if she does not want to be with you, try to be her friend.
if he says he is not, believe him.

i do not like a guy that does that all of the time.
then you can make an easier decision.
i have had sexual intercourse with many girls, and some of them were whores.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores _num_ points.
talk to your best friend and see if it is cool.

i do not know; can i do anything about it?
people are husbands and wives for reasons!
if he doesn't, then there are too many fish in the sea.
or do you just want to say that?
if you are not happy then you need to fix it or leave.
not all men, however some men do.
i completely agree with 'udaman", best of luck.
you seem to try too hard for others approval.
your girlfriend will only think that you are being a jerk.
occasionally, but you have to observe your significant other.
are you replaying everything that you did to me?
do not sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
a guy that i dated this past year, got to the point of violence.
i do not care what she says, leave it alone, she is in enough pain.

we were spending a little time together.
do not use pick up lines. that is a turn off.
i love them because i am a man, and i do not have to ask anyone to the dance.

the women that whine about flowers' inability to last are just ungrateful.
you need to be with that person once you have found your true love.
i mean that you have to really be her friend.
how do i get my significant other to show me that he loves me.

they have never met but she says they are in love.
you have to do this in person and not on the phone or through email.
gay people are some of the best friends a person could have.
i met a girl and i want to know if she likes me or not.

just try to make the best of what is to come.

she is the love of my life and i cannot wait to spend the rest of it with her.
women think with their brains.
i still love my ex, and i am very angry at my cousin because my ex likes her.
only time will tell. spend time with his friends, have fun, and do not think about it.
that is why i do not go to chat rooms anymore, unless it is to have a laugh at those in them.
this is what i did, and i feel i made a mistake in doing so.
i do not know where to begin.
he cheated, however, which i believe means i can lift or carry my husband.

oh, i should do that when i am seeing someone the next time!
do not listen to what any other person tells you to do.
i really am attracted to this man, and i do not know if it is just a phase, or if i have love for him...
i believe the bomb is much more simple!
not always the most simple, but they have been pretty decent years.
don't forget to decide. vote for the best answer.
you need to admit why you're attracted to her.
is he a homosexual, or is it curiosity?
no, not if you need to question.

i was not going to let her win.
chandes are that if you like her as a friend, you will like her as more than a friend.

my boyfriend loves my very much, and doesn't want to ever leave me.
you are doing so already so why still bother?
on the hood of my car during a light rain at the waterfront; it was amazing.
i believe you're a good man. most likely she loves you quite a bit.
you're looking too hard, or perhaps, searching in the incorrect sites. sign up for yahoo! personals.
if that's want you want.
if she doesn't have a reason, then she isn't your chum!
you need to see discern what's correct for you both.
you are definitely not an easy woman, don't worry
girl's don't think that smoking is attractive, they find it rather disgusting.
do you like asian cuisine?
it is not their intention to impregnate a women, they just get ahead of themselves.

i still love him. what should i do?
do stay with him just for the baby.
never ignore her, always listen to her and never change the subject when you do, women do not like that.
it can also be good luck if you take it as such.
it is a trait of a man having to live with an ego.
it sounds as if you are going through a lot right now.
good luck, but do your homework.
do not come here, it smells like a trap to me.
everywhere, ask any girl passing by, but only in thailand, not the united states.

some guys think they do not need you until you are gone.
i wish you good luck.
i hope you married your husband because you love him.
i like to express myself through poetry to the women in my life.
why limit yourself to just one man?
that is, if you both agreed to do this.
that is like saying, "what is there to stop me after i have already done it?"
he simply has to start over, and regain your trust again.
the only family member i have met of his was his father.
we fall in love, they treat us badly. why do we keep doing this to ourselves?
i am one that wants to wait, until i am completely in love with someone special.

i suppose it is rather nice. it is like having your father's blessing completely.
i like intelligent, entertaining, and attractive women.
come to my town. i will be your girlfriend.
this is not an intelligent generation.
it is time to cash out.
they lust for each other.
i become happy when i see an advertisement for malaysia air on television.
the way he asked me on a date was very nice.
attempt to converse with her and ask to spend time together as friends and see if it leads anywhere.
this is difficult because there are many temptations.
you do not have to become that just because she says so.
the two of you should talk privately and personally. you have to clarify each other's side, so do it now!
well, the one i enjoyed went like this.
try not to have sex.
just keep it cool. it might help to be a little hard to get!
if your relationship has survived the "four seasons" i suppose that you should be ready.

if you are desperate, then ask him out, if not, then wait.
are you asking if i like you?
whatever you decide, make it completely yours!
you cannot fix it with her parents. you might be able to sweet talk her friends. but please specify, why?
how intoxicated is she?
women are attracted to confident men.
i am only doing this so that i will receive points.
if you two do not know anything about each other, you will be unable to connect.
if you truly do, i would say that is was a real relationship. best of luck to you.
but really. if you are used to it, and you kind of like it, then go with it.
because it is buy one, take one.
and, last but not least, does he always just happen to be staring?
it sounds like a con, but i am telling you that women enjoy it.
you've only met men with a specific preference.
i have always believed that there is a difference between intercourse, and intimate relations.
you have to distance yourself.
in my case i think it is eighty percent.
leaning towards me and kissing me gently on only the forehead.
i cannot imagine my life without my husband.
i do. it is much more attractive and as smooth as silk.
however, flowers are very nice even if they are not lasting.
it seems that he is enjoying him self overly much while you are away.
what's the explanation for one's inability to pester the young woman?
perhaps you should attempt to pursue young women, given the tendency by men to be offensive.
in addition, i am in possession of no girlfriends whatsoever.
do not forget, "s" is attracted to men who present their true selves to the world, and no one else!
their opinion is they've exceeded the skill level of females, however, they're inorrect.
that fact does not mean that you should let them in your circle.
that thought is always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends to talk with on the phone?
getting married and having children can wait, but school cannot wait.
you need to do this a few times to get comfortable.
most teen boys prefer girls that like sex.
don't look back and enjoy the friends you have.
if its your personal belief in something its not good or bad.
i don't know what i should do.
yes, it is a stupid habit.
wait until you turn _num_ because you will not lose your charm by then.
my best friend dislikes my boyfriend and wishes that i would break up with him, but i will not.
relax and be yourself because that is what we like.
i do not think so. perhaps they should try our last names.
you should both pick either his or yours when you have children.
of course he wants to continue.
i guess i picked a domestic goddess.
try asking her out after class.
live life to the fullest and have faith.
i am a man so i also have feelings.
give him a call.
start with a basic, everyday question and go from there.
you should tell more people.
all that my friends want to do is conjugate.
actual kissing and asking if you are a desirable kisser.
we will not regret being at your service anytime.
you need to replace it, just add it back in, the same way you did the first time.
you can share this with your mother and father.
do not fall for the, "alcoholic only on the weekends," line that guy is giving you.
unless you know him fairly well, you are stinking yourself out there to get hurt.
a & b cups are preferable.
start a friendship first, then let the relationship develop.
don't listen to what people, (not just men), say; watch how they act.
do you feel the same?
however, if a man asks you, do not be afraid to reject him.
obviously, she is not interested in you, if you know she is interested in the other boy.
there are many factors that cause a woman to dislike intercourse.
not all men become bored and move on.
but there is no better person to marry than your best friend.
it depends on what you are searching for, as in friendship only, etc.
i behaved as such in the company of my present romantic partner.
however, it's not defined as you both being unable to have affection for one another.
simply dissolve the marriage. he possesses no valor and he has no feelings for you.
in essence, males simply desire a female romantic partner in order to have sexual relations!
should no action prevail, you must request it of him once more.
keep your personality, do not let any man determine how you behave.
search yourself for this one.
you will not need to if the man is worthy.
i do not like it when she is like that. i am confused, what should i do?
shop around for invitations, and everything else!
he then asked me, "can i come with you?"
act based on your feelings. if you like her that much, then go with it.
i am only myself around guys i do not like. you know how that turns out.
i hope that you find a nice girl to date.
i have liked one girl since i was in _num_ grade.
hi and hugs to all my fellow girls at cone!
if she likes him, there is a reason.
if going to a movie is special for the two of you, do that.
it seems as though you are in charge.
have you told her it irritates you to have her check on you every day?
for the same reason thin women prefer slender, toned men.
he handed me his cellular phone, and had me input my phone number.
go to hawaii, or pay someone.
i do not understand why people think it is wrong.
keep searching for a believer in romance. she is out there!
you are not a good person of you plan to be unfaithful to your wife.
he knows that you like him, has he said anything bad about it?
the only way you will know is if you confront him and ask him directly.
that is more of a trust issue.
never give up trying to impress her.
you are being punished, so you don't get to watch tv for a month.
i think this is better than my personal life.
that doesn't bother me, i just said that we are only friends.
go to school. you can still come home or call your family or friends.
go with the one that picks on you, because nine times out of ten, he likes you.
i always felt the same way, however, i met my true love and my views changed.
take a bath? do you know how to speak?
i enjoy his company and he says things like, if i were not dating, i would go out with you.
just dispose of him and you will be better off.
this is the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love.
people asked me what the hurry was?
has he ever just broke up with a girl and left before?
i am _num_ now and still need therapy for it.
for goodness sakes, do not allow me to be one of those controlling mothers.
did you ever think about that?
it has been half of a year, is it normal for me to still have affection for him?
search for a man that is attractive!
it is really nice and just what you are searching for!
is there a reason that you are not with the infant's father?
no, it is certainly unacceptable. you are simply wasting your health because women simply hate it.
anything larger than a handful, probably a size c or d, is excessive.
in my opinion, they do.
stop attempting to mock everyone with it.
you should look for somewhere in public, where you will feel most comfortable.
a man asked if i would mind cuddling with him.
ask what the score of the last game was.
some couples are never going to be that comfortable with each other.
you should not do anythign that you will regret later.
it would be ok the day after.
you are missing a smile.
the same thing happenned to me.
i do not like girls.
you should be nice, give eye contact, and smile.
i wonder why he shaved his legs.
i wish you luck.
i have heard this many times.
i will go with anything natural, but nothing fake. i despise that word.
i would date someone ten years younger. who wants to date an older woman?
you should ask your best friend if it would be okay to do that.
many people will tell you no when you ask.
there is a lot to do on the weekends in downtown houston.
someone claimed women do not have feelings?
do not be shallow and start with her looks.
move on if they have.
flirt with him and gauge his reaction.
i am waiting until i am married, but when is it too far?
there is nothing wrong with her taking your number.
and you do not need to be an overly-happy, hyper-active person.
i do not want to approach suddenly and ask, "will you go out with me?"
then the enjoyable part happens: him making it up to you.
you have to spend at least _num_ minuites on kissing and hugging.
i can not help you unless i have more information.
i say no on avatars.
some girls prefer gifts that will last and not die on them.
he is probably wondering if you are interested in him at all. flirt back.
i feel goofy, dorky and happy.
if you are a hoe then he is one too. i personally don't think you are one though.
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
i don't need a trophy, i want a companion.
as a man, let me say this.
be confident and always believe in yourself. do not become arrogant, though. always make good eye-contact and listen to what she has to say.
then he said, "do you want some of my chapstick?"
kissing is something you cannot do wrong or right.
we love them ,adn it is not untill later we thing about what we have done.
i do not know. i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you made?
it is similar to breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem crazy because you have known one another for a long time.
good, that girl answered the first question for me.
instead, how about blue and green?
a life of your own. a life that you've been missing out on.
confusing, yes, you're correct.
you don't necessary have to ask her out on a date, to go out with her.
perhaps he will call you.
alright, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
in a park when i was _num_, is where i lost my virginity.
what man does like big breasts?
you should be proud of yourself.
men work and fix things, but what can you do?
we do not know what you look like!
what four qualities whould you want in a woman?
you can get plenty of ideas for your wedding from the internet, local newspaper, or news.
it is a turn off if she sits on your best friend's lap when drunk.
see my boyfriend on my _num_ profile?
you will find a man who really deserves you one day.
it is you and that sexy perfume that you wear.
if you and him are still not ready, then forget about him.
why do they want it state sanctioned?
and she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons.
you can still love him ,but you need to move on.
is he willing to go out of the way for you?
if anyone has the answer, let me know.
i never knew life could be good.
he said he would call me back.
you pick the one you like the most.
you need to take it off.
if you love him, you will tell him.
i would enjoy that being done to me.
what should i do to be successful with her?
you must be controlled and introduce yourself.
there are films that i have yet to see.
i believe it all depends on age and upbringing.
that will just be sexual intercourse.
my partner was absolutely my friend first and it is wonderful!
who has a care for what any other person thinks.
attempting to get some blonde highlights as well.
just let it all out. i use art a lot to vent when i have problems.
if she likes music, make her a special cd or tape.
it could be. choose one and indicate why.
do not worry about what people will say.
i think a lot of girls like getting flowers.
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable, young or submissinve.
you need to let him go or date his brother.
you have to look.
you can get them at staples for thirty-five dollars.
your child is going to have a difficult time growing up without a father.
my friend tells me that i am too nice, and that i should tell him no.
my girlfriend always says she loves me when we are passing notes during class but she doesn't say it face to face.
that's right, the relationship happened on it's own.
you will look like a fool.
no, and you should not care. stay with him if you like him.
i think you should be yourself. have self-esteem and self-confidence.
any item that has not been nailed down!
make it your top priority to see her, if you really want to be with her that badly.
a few months ago, one of my best friends was in a relationship with my older sister.
should i just forget about it and move on?
their friends on the other hand are a different story.
yes i do, i believe that anyone does.
my cousin met up with some weird old pervert saying he was a attractive teen that she met online.
nobody was on my list, so i choose my neighbor's wife.
i have long black hair and love it. my husband loves it too.
you care what happens, and everyone in your family will love you.
unattractive guys take whatever girls they can get.
it happened in the middle of the river while people were watching. it was actually pretty funny!
it is all in the eye contact.
it depends on the guy. some guys do and some do not.
it sort of gives us the impression that you may not have strong guts.
sure, if you love him and he really loves you, but he may not want to disappoint his father.
yes, some men get right down to it with no thought for the woman at all.
perhaps she is not mean and the skinny girl is.
it does sound somewhat feminine.
if you would like to enjoy it a bit, you should check out some restaurants, night clubs or gyms.
there are a lot of good women left, you just need to look in the right places.
the truth is that everyone has to separate one day or another.
you win some, you lose some. take it with a grain of salt, and be more careful next time.
happy birthday, to you.
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out.
pick the one that treats you better.
i am into a _num_ grade boy, too.
if you end the relationship, he might not continue to be your friend. that is why i do not date my friends.
stick yourself out there, you have to do a lot more than eye contact.
do what is best for you and him.
bad teeth, breath, and body odor.
no one needs to know that.
if i have to ask then i will leave the relationship and move on with my life.
hey, do not misunderstand me.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes, but he did not act like it.
where am i looking to go with this?
as one gets older, keep getting younger and younger men, to make you feel better.
you know that it would be if you did not play, 'the guilt trip."
that does not means that it makes it correct, it only means that it makes us human.
it is a mistake that cannot be undone.
practice unwrapping starburst and tying cherry stems, with your tongue.
did you catch her looking at you?
i know three guys that can probably get away with doing something like that.
ask her out or at least tell her that you like and admire her.
if he is going to on and off like that, i say break up with him for good!
if they do not, then you will have to get on with your life.
i have never been.
complement her, ask for her name. do not act weird, act like you have confidence.
she calls him all the time.
how should i approach her and not be just another man hitting on her?
wait a little while and then date because that way you will enjoy it more.
someone who acts calm just because she thinks it is cool, but it is not.
it is because you do not have any power over the decision.
i know, so why should i hide it?
certain men simply have no inclination toward dancing.
sincerely, she shouldn't be considered a compatriot of yours due to her inability to refrain from being an annoyance to you!
my wish is that i had paid attention to the comments from my circle.
how much time must pass before you can decide it consumes too much time and she has no genuine interest?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
that is a nice picture of george clooney.
some women fo not find guys their own age attractive.
i would not want a pair that big.
it sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are now.
i think it is beautiful. it looks great on most any woman.
sometimes, it is better to be good friends first, and make sure you are happy around one another.
will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill's song "love ain't like that". it is a great example.
please, do not ask that question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
your partner should accept that if they truly care about you.
i am attracted to men who shave their legs.
if you are still in communications with each other, i do not think that is the best thing to do.
i am attracted this man, austin, and i told my friend, claudia, to ask him if he adores me also.
you are slaying the romance by popping the obtuse question. ever thought about just enjoying each other, instead?
trust me, he is a player and no good.
it depends, they all adore different ones, but definitely, not ones that are egotistical, aberrations like you happen to be.
i think that is fantastic, perhaps you should make the first move.
if he turns you down, he is not worth it in the first place.
just go up to her.
it is a good idea to always be honest because not many guys are going to dislike being told they are attractive.
they know the women will not chase them unlike good looking men who attract plenty of women.
ask him if he would like to see a movie.
they call it making love.
he will know you like him if you smile at him.
she will answer the question, because most girls are polite.
you sound like my best friend.
ask him when he is taking you to dinner.
i think a lot of guys do not care.
it will work out if you want it to.
do not force him to dance if he does not want to.
the guy should make the first move.
without being in a relationship, that might appear to be a little promiscuous.
wait and take it from a military woman.
you never know, they only show affection when they want something.
i am _num_ years old. i am looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly more.
did you mean, "seems more provocative?"
go to deleted items and it should be there.
i wonder if this is a red flag that tells you who this man really is.
maybe it is because your name is "freakgirl", but if i meet you maybe there will be no hard feelings.
i have been there and know that would be so very painful.
do you love her deeply?
have a good time in jail asking your cell mate that question.
no, the only time that you see a man that is emotions is when he is with the woman he loves.
yes, i have accomplished it and it was a blast.
you have to let the person you are with know what you desire.
of course, if she telephones me five times a day about that, then it would be absurd.
hang in there and wait for one who appreciates you.
my mom books them all the time.
besides, do you not think he has enough to worry about?
i have been seeing this man that is younger than i.
men toy with emotions to receive sexual relations, women toy with sexual relations to receive love.
it has got to get old after a while.
every person likes to be told that they are good looking, even if they do not admit it!
yes, but it depends on the guy.
maybe because you just think they look attractive when they are running on the field.
you are too young to be talking about kissing already.
i probably will tell her soon because she is my best friend, and any help would be nice.
i agree with the other person before anyone gets hurt.
i'm keen to press on, but i love him way too much
do everything that you couldn't, when you were dating them.
obviously, men are not much better.
what occurs if you inform him that you wish to be friends with benefits?
play a truth or dare game together.
he sounds like a manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace with foreplay.
death is like a big black bag full of crack, smack, or meth.
practice kissing on me, so where do you live?
no, you will not; i was married to a rude person.
it sounds as if you like her and there is not need to attempt to forget about her.
tell him ath you simply want to be friends are are disappointed by his thoughtless actions.
it cannot remain hidden, so do not do it.
what is with chest hair?
although mad and upset, he did get over you.
give your brother money and send him on his way.
no disrespect intended; but, that does sound like a lady's name.
be calm, and ask her out on a date.
when you take her out, take some time to get to know her and then go ahead and ask her out.
people do not like to be played back and forth.
practice unwrapping starburst wrappers with your tongue, the girls really like it.
i do not know, i only want the points.
that is not exactly true, it is just that most girls are discreet about it.
that depends, are you an attractive woman with a body?
i told him it was too late, but i would not have minded getting flowers sometimes.
believing in someone is a strange way to put it.
why can men never say the word "love?"
just enjoy your age and do not worry about this.
although i am nineteen, i enjoy anything up to thirty.
i had a friend in the same situation.
women are just as perverted, trust me.
you should not go out with a guy because you 'need' to.
man, what you are saying is that she does not want to be more than boyfriend and girlfriend?
how long does it take for you to start feeling bored in a relationship?
i knew all the girlfriends were not the one, until i met my wife.
i think as long as the backbone of your relationship isn't intercourse, it is fine.
why do some men do that?
if you're average, breast size won't really matter.
stay away from men who cannot tell you they like you.
yes, ask for permission, then watch how fast she will slap you.
my husband likes me the way i am.
my mother also has cancer and this just gets me emotional.
then be your best self. if he is impressed or likes you, he will talk back.
you do not want anyone else but that person ever.
why don't you try chatting with and seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
but it is okay to kiss on the first date.
men have problems with secrets.
someone got vulgar with me because i was still dating?
how do i just kiss him?
i am my only sister's maid-of-honor and i want it to be perfect.
unless it is with the wrong man.
is it a rebound relationship for both of you?
good luck in your search for a new love.
why do people seem to want someone they can not have, and know they should not want?
do you like to argue and fight?
if that is your decision, then that is what you should do.
my ex of three years cheated on me.
work at it, but do not allow him to keep you locked up at home.
other than those two things, ask him once in awhile.
men get bored and tired before women do.
she is really tough and loving and above all...really was not as happy as she appeared to be.
it is one way of stating i do not like you!
king did have a song about this=only your mother loves you (and find might be jiving too).
he loves you too, lady...time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone to come home to.
i do not know if you fell down, but i want to have sex.
do you want to keep all of your friends forever?
acting that way does not make you a slut.
i enjoy going to a club and dancing.
don't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex.
going there is great fun, and there are plenty of things to do.
it will all depend on when you are ready.
stay very far away from this man.
you should be prepared because if it happened once it could happen again.
i am looking for the girl who wants to spend time with me.
at least not until he finds another girlfriend.
my wife says we don't wear things like that.
if you are uncertain, you should break up and open yourself to seeing other people.
why do same-sex couples want to be married?
don't say sorry to him unless you've actually made a mistake.
do you have to rush this decision?
they both disrespect your feelings.
no, seriously. think about how many arrogant women are out there.
she is frightened about asking him on a date.
get a grip! how can you love someone, with whom you cannot even communicate?
i would ask you on a date, but i live in oregon, and i have no idea where you live.
they have never performed before, and it doubles the pleasure!
i will go and see one.
i am happy that i have brown hair.
if you email me, i can tell you the answer.
it is a challange.
i will help you.
do not let them know in advance but rather allow them to discover once you are in bed together.
i should have kept my last name.
i rarely see him in school but i have seen him attending my brother's basketball games.
he is a womanizer and has been telling that to some young woman.
break up with him. there are plenty of fish in the sea.
i know, because i am like your wife.
when she calls, you should text her back.
no way, i am only _num_" and he is _num_".
you do not know the first rule, trust no one.
we've attempted to end the relationship on several occasions however we never succeed.
oh, and a portion due to them being slender and slim and these days young women suffering anorexia are sexually exciting.
given that you possess male genitalia, it isn't an issue. you are simply required to insert your engorged member into her vagina.
in such a circumstance, enroll in some self-defense courses.
i just escaped a three-year romance with the father of my newborn.
want to hear a bad joke?
i have been working for years.
we like a soft approach with a little chasing.
you would be suprised at the type of people that are interested in them.
it is very enjoyable, especially when you meet each other after exchanging text messages for a few months.
i am in new york city. i will help you if you are nearby.
it sounds strange but it worked in about three to five days for me.
do not worry, i do not have much to work with either.
why does their opinion matter? if they do not get along, then do not spend time together.
should he behave as such, you are in possession of a quality male!
if he has affection for you, you will be aware!
i imagine it's common, however, i'd simply proceed.
the remainder is simple from this point forward!
i am fond of all gentlemen with a sense of humor.
young lady, you are the singular person capable of rendering this decision.
what's the reason for posing the query?
proceed to inform all simply due your belief that it is correct to do so.
ten years' separation is simply appealing.
after that if he still does not like you, then you need to move on.
even though i see him each week in psr i can not find the courage to talk to him.
because they feel less secure with men who are less educated.
one reason is that if it does not work out you could lose your job.
also i pray that it does not ever pass.
only the ones that are not worth your time.
smaller of course, and it is all about how they look.
you guys do not have any reason to hate one another.
if you do not. you will always wonder.
people choose not to because of their religion, while others do not.
give it a chance, because if you break up with them it would be harder to be simply friends.
best of luck to you.
men who were not ready to commit.
it is a big day in both of your lives, it should not be done quickly or without thought.
i am _num_-years-old and still live at home with my mother. what is wrong with that?
i want one man willing to move _num_ hours and _num_,_num_ miles away to be with me.
i must not be unattractive enough, then.
that is alright. i am a giver.
well, it depends on the woman. what does she want?
remember: it takes two, and not one.
he would have dumped her for you, if he really preferred you over her.
hang around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
please do not miss out on this one!
women do not like men who are cocky.
stick with what is inside of you.
it happenned to me, twice.
maybe you are too young.
actions are better then words.
there is nothing in the world like a big-boned woman!
do not sell yourself, even if he is rich.
i am a gay male, aged thirty, and i just moved to sacramento, ca.
the people who are around you now should like you no matter what, especially your friends!
because they like small breasts and vaginas.
wait till you are older and then if you both still feel the same you can go for it.
yes, i am not one of those people but i know there are many of them around.
no, it is not if you have to ask.
and you want to give oral sex to another man?
it is because they are girls and not as sophisticated as we are.
does this mean that he is attracted to me?
do not worry about him. just concentrate on school; learn and then worry about your boyfriend.
i know, because i dated one.
look at the way that she walks.
the answer is no, i least i hope not.
hello, i am looking forward to visiting your country.
should i give him another chance, overtime?
is he the same man that you wanted to be in a relationship with?
i traveled there and he was present.
that's the name i applied to it. for what reason, though?
by doing so, you're still able to retain your surname.
you two individuals toil rigorously to achieve accuracy!
i've previously communicated my affection to her and she expressed her concern about damaging our relationship as friends.
you can join a community that has live and webcam chat.
show her your naked baby photos.
it is very important to last at least _num_ to _num_ minutes.
however, i am not telling you to be celibate until that time!
it is okay to jump on him if he is flirting with her.
i adore curly hair as i favor running my fingers through it.
i desire my wife to grow as well.
well, that is simply the manner it is done, i suppose.
one female, michelle, who most likely would not being mentioned, stated that she did not believe in it.
i can simply ignore him and forget about him similarly to the previous night's garbage.
he was busy after that time.
i don't know what to do about it, she knows i care about him so much.
if you eat something similar to that, then you should quit.
it could be that you need to use the bathroom, or had a dream about it.
if he wanted to wear my pants, all he would have to do is ask.
if you were friends before and have stronger feeling now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what kind of flower arrangements you would like.
deceive and mislead and then fabricate some more.
first, wait until you find that out for sure and then go from there.
he should not care if the two of you were at a dance.
trust him and do not bring it up again.
honestly, most women are waiting for the man to tell her how he truly feels.
of course i would love to meet women.
i actually ponder this one every once in awhile.
i met a man in a rainstorm, it was very romantic.
some men prefer women like that, and some do not.
it comes after three play and before five play.
when i fall in love, i feel stupid.
if you have to ask, then you are not in love.
if you start to feel it coming on, then resume the foreplay.
i do not understand. someone, please give me the answer.
i saved a good five-to-six-hundred dollars doing my own flowers, and it was no hassle at all.
he and i just got a divorce!
however, you ought to ask a girl regarding the symptoms, since i am a boy.
be authentic and demonstrate some machismo. that is what women, or at least most women, like. however, foremost is being authentic.
listen to your intuition. it is never wrong.
they harass you throughout the day.
notice whether he call, emails or even cares.
you could provide a civilian arrest answer.
usually that is caused by a spasm in the back.
by this time, you should love your wife for everything the two of you have endured.
good luck on your new adventure. i hope everything goes well!
you can start by saying i love you and wait to see if they say it back.
ask her on a date again and see what she says.
there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
ask her questions, do not merely talk.
when you initially fall in love, you become biddy and oddly happy merely thinking of that person.
remember that there is more than one.
i believe they look better than many other nations.
we got married again!
all in all i do not think it matters.
i am definitely not driving five hours just to see her unless i really like her.
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her and meant it.
what good did it bring?
i am a person that does not like to break the other persons heart.
give a rose and express your love.
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one.
remember that it is "till death do you part".
because we always find a life partner, therefore, we are attracted to the opposite side.
what in the world are you speaking of?
if you persist in speaking to him for another week, he may believe he is married to you.
women do not desire very much, just some acknowledgement and at times assistance.
at least, that is what it seems like to me.
do not be afraid to say, "no."
end things with him, there are always more fish in the sea.
to me it really does not matter. a hand full is quite enough for me.
choose the one that cherishes you the most.
you still released a thousand, at least.
you go get inebriated at a bar.
give it some time and thought.
you should not leave them, just teach them what to do to better satisfies you.
bembie got the answer correct.
the two of you should kiss when you are ready.
julesac is funny, yet callous.
if you are asking this, then you surely have already distanced yourself from her, yet remaining a friend.
do not forget ot vote for best answer.
it is just the way things are.
i know of another website that i go to.
are you starting to have feelings for this boy?
he had a controlling personality.
it depends on how interested one party is in the other.
you should attempt to get out and meet people.
usually there are multiple factors instead of just one.
if you truly like them.
do you men prefer a big woman or a smaller woman?
it is not worth it, if all you do is argue.
i went out with him for _num_ years, it makes the situation worse.
you have to be patient and the right girl will come around.
do you not love your husband, because you have room for another man?
you can do more without commiting a sin if she is your wife.
she does want you to think she is attractive, but does not want that to be the only reason.
some says i want to have sex, and some days i do not want to.
they are more passionate when making love.
you may enjoy sex that much more if you play with both at the same time.
i left him because he was a bad man.
it may be due to the fact that you are the most beautiful woman they have ever seen.
it depends on if they are vain.
i want someone that likes me for me.
send a picture of yourself to me, and please be in contact.
stay away from this man.
the doctor was surprised as well.
exactly, especially when she became sick.
i can give you pointers.
if you feel that your love is fading, you have to do something.
i will not stay with a person i do not trust.
only once did i tell a girl that i was in love with her, and i meant it.
you married him and there was a reason.
tear off your shirt and scream like tarzan.
yes, girl beneath there, do not have sexual relations.
they are accepting of this in their culture.
always ride with a friend.
you did not give us very good information. do you all live in one house?
move on. what does it matter if he is attractive? appearance is not all-important.
most importantly, be genuine.
you are justified in feeling disappointed and angry.
i am soory, but i have never felt that way.
i do not like a woman who makes my life difficults.
you get the popcorn if he gets them first.
practice asking if you are performing well.
but if you are sure then first tell your parents if you have not done so already.
well, i met mine at a carnival.
that sounds like a rhetorical question.
well, i believe that everyone should keep his or her own name.
your first kiss should make you feel as if you are in heaven.
this seems like it is going to be problematic.
how can i make a woman happy?
don't try something that will hurt you.
you will always make money if you work hard.
don't just walk up and tell her how good she looks.
i do not think this is a good idea; you are not there for this purpose.
approach her, say hello, and ask if she is single.
i think he would make a wonderful valentine.
be prepared to let her go.
rather than simply waiting until you are acceptable.
ask if they are going to become violent.
get a massage, and take some time off from everything.
if you actually like this guy, make more of an effort to talk to him.
bring both of them out on a date.
it has happened to me, and now i am dating said person.
there are two points to making friends. _num_)
so you might not be looking for the type of man who thinks the world of you.
it should be someone who does not hate you.
we tried moving on but it did not work.
when will pepole begin to realize this?
i would not call him back.
try not to spend time with him and find another man.
find a different attractive woman, she will become jealous.
in my opinion you are not a hoe.
red means love, black means death, etc.
if she likes him then she does not like you. break up with her, it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, any longer than three days and i may begin to forget you.
find a woman with talents who is also attractive.
there is no one whom you can trust more than a good friend.
start the day off with breakfast and then perhaps a nice walk.
then go pick them up, if she says yes, of course.
if yes, why do i hear some women say flowers are not going to last?
maybe it is interesting for them.
i wonder if it could ever be the same after that.
it is not as bad as it could have been; at least it is not bella.
is it possible that the answer is because some men are not truthful and boastful?
another option is that you could tell her and have a fairy tale romance.
finally a culture that has it right.
my twin will not talk or listen to me.
if you want to get something that you cannot get rid of, then go ahead.
i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
if you are talking ten dollars, then i think it would be fine to get a computer game.
take a chance and go for it.
if he can not dance, take him to a place where they have slow dances.
i feel that a family life is beautiful.
i dislike them, but if you like them, it is ok.
you should never get married without a prenuptial agreement.
find a way to have a life, and do not waste mine.
she said that you are too good for her?
men will come and go, but friends are forever.
i may mean a lot of things.
yes, it is typical. their are many people who still are attracted to an individual they no longer see.
i'd enjoy seeing what a african american female has to say about this.
men are idiotic. no one comprehends why they do what they do.
if they presented you with their phone number, no need to wait.
because we're masters of the universe.
i am in love and i do not care who loves it.
whatever you do, do not try to have them both at once.
if you were truly interested in being with him, you would not be asking.
remember that being friends with someone online is ok, however, there are limits.
when my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes.
i personally would not want to marry any woman who does not want to change her name.
a small party for the family.
women are degenerates. they merely hide it and behave that way in secret around other women.
and i am only in fifth grade.
but you should do what you want.
avoid doing that as it will not work.
if they do not do that, then it is time to leave.
he has everything i am looking for in a guy.
it is bad luck to see your bride at the wedding.
she is not a false witness.
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation that you wish.
he had his nose pierced.
yes, i can lift him, he is only _num_
you will need a therapist for that.
there are some perverted guys that like young looking asian girls.
you should see a therapist.
he is giving you a poor excuse for acting in a way he did not before.
be strong, and hang in there.
he is too large, and i am weak.
it is unattractive if she is heavily intoxicated and becomes messy.
keep in touch by sending letters, emails, talking on the phone.
especially if you do not feel like it.
he dribbles, he shoots, and he scores two points.
giving it up for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
i cannot give you a wife-view, but hopefully mine is as good.
plus, if takes the pressure off of me to ask someone.
it depends on the woman. it is better if it is shaved.
ask the question using english terms. i am not able to understand you.
hello. i am a man but i will tell you a little.
i like him very much but i want to persuade him not reject him.
i really, really think a guy is attractive but don't know if he feels that way about me.
by the way, your avatar looks familiar.
we broke up over six months ago, and i cannot seem to move on.
maybe he thinks he will be turned down. i would just ask him.
thinking about that should help you in seeing whether or not you can trust him.
a photograph in the shape of a heart with you and her on your first date. that is special.
i am in college and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
it is not that simple. i acquired my first boyfriend in second grade, then again in fourth, and again in eighth.
i have been in a relationship with this woman for eight months and we have not kissed. is this bad?
some men do not like breasts at all.
does she want to see other people?
he has seen me everyday for about _num_ or _num_ years.
it was his stop, so he got off the train.
the absolute worst situation that could occur is that he states no. good luck with your opportunity.
i'm aware of exactly what i want in a relationship.
i would flirt, tease, then mail flowers and candies to myself. he'd ask me out eventually.
i dislike seeing my father unhappy.
i feel bad because i snore sometimes. don't most people snore when they sleep?
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love.
if the two of you truly love each other, then you will work things out.
the relationship is still happening because neither of you have the courage to end things.
girls who are heavier can still be attractive.
but he is getting married this month.
but those men are rude and you do not want them anyway.
say, "will you go out with me?"
and get married only after you have been with a man for more than two years.
a man has a penis and a woman has a clitoris.
ignore the bad and move on!
however, it would be easier if i was angry!
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america
you should get to know her. sooner or later you will ask her out or vice versa.
as i said, he knows you are interested in him, so take a deep breath and ask him.
perhaps you and i can get together sometime; we may find love.
i would be, however i just got married.
explore your options for a while.
do not get married so early in the relationship.
have you seen a doctor yet?
you should pay attention to that the other person is saying.
simply discuss the subject with your spouse.
given your attraction to sixth grade children, you're apparently youthful.
i've been contemplating a mid-level pink hue, however, what should it be alongside?
inquire of their desire to travel to a location accompanied by you.
a visit to an amusement park with a roller coaster. perhaps a theatrical museum.
do men truly prefer bigger women?
my concern is that i'm deeply attracted to him.
i believe they do work out, although not often. i hope i helped.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i accidentally did this before and my friend was angry that i had deleted him.
i do not mind either way.
you could try it her way or you could try keeping your eyes open.
you should be able to tell the few that will.
are you talking about your avatar?
i dont remember giving a woman a christmas gift unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself and do not try to impress anyone.
just take it day by day and think of how he lost a good thing.
darn it, if only every man had knowledge of what women want, the world would be a much better place!
compliments, be honest and focus on her.
i believe she will wreck him!
it just means that she seems to be really interested in the man.
please do, i am thinking you would be slapped as you reach out or perhaps kicked in the groin.
except now we are both divorced.
if he/she wants to see your photograph immediately, then it is sex.
it is better than her giving you a false phone number to call.
tell her to move to massachussetts.
if you feel that strongly about it, then perhaps you should not get married.
from the pictures that i have seen, i would say maui or the bahamas.
the man i like is upset with me.
you are _num_, do not even worry about it.
that way you do not have to worry about phoning him too much!
i am a man, and let me tell you, we love to chase!
thank you in advance for the support!
we seem to always push away the ones who we love.
the believe that they can control others lives when they cannot.
that is weird, but perhaps i will talk to my friend near his locker.
i do not know; how would you feel if something were in your anus?
if a man cares he will call.
what special gift can i give my would-be brother-in-law for his birthday?
he likely does not want to either.
hold her hands, look into her eyes, and say it; but only say it if you really love her.
some guys do, and some guys do not.
can you help me get to know her?
the timing was not right to date the older guy.
i want a girl who is kind, and intelligent.
determination is one of the gifts we can give ourselves.
i don't believe you need to earn someone's trust, how is that possible?
so if that is you, you need to stop, it is too bizarre.
don't let her control your life, she will have to learn to live with it.
i have a yahoo account, and that is fine with me.
i wouldn't worry too much about it.
oh yes, the trick that person never had a chance.
when you can fart in front of the one you are dating.
depends on how old they are.
any man that states he would is more than likely not being entirely honest with himself.
if you bat your eyes at him, the challenge is nonexistent.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you do have some problems.
twenty to thirty-two, she does not have to be younger than you.
perhaps she doesn't love you, but attempt to use your brain and not your head.
if you want to spend forever with her, do not tell her.
there are plenty of inexpensive ideas. find what you are interested in and work from there.
if you are worried about your performance, do not.
find another woman. if that does not work, move back.
most often (although not always), there will be men who are approximately your age.
if you act in that manner at all times, she might find you desperate.
not everyone here is in school.
communicate to him what you really want and speak up; that is what they tell me but i never got to do.
should i make the first move or wait for him to do so?
you have set up a double standard.
after some time, you will not see the color.
i am still trying to work up my nerves to try that out.
if it is serious between the two of you, then that question should not bother her.
what is up with her?
try using the phrase, "would you like to go out with me sometime?
if you are in florida, look me up.
those were the best of times.
it is all about her and it should not occur on the first date.
you have do decide whether you want to spend the rest of your life with someone with whom you constantly argue.
if he comes to his senses, great; if not, you should move on.
you deserve more than them.
she likes him so you are going to jump him?
either a cd or a dvd will be appropriate.
star fresh and be all that you can.
i would like to visit the united states. what do i need to bring?
if anyone has any ideas, tips, or general information, email me back please!
you sound like a lovely person, so do not let some of these women drag you down.
do not look. just go out, enjoy yourself, have fun, and a girlfriend will come along.
do not pursue it because he is getting married.
is it like a clear liquid that turns yellow when dry?
if your country has a short messaging system in cell phones then find a someone to text with!
then when she starts to close her eyes, kiss her lips. after that it is up to you!
please be honest, i can handle the truth.
have fun. and remember to never get so comfortable that it becomes predictable!
it shows how much they care about you.
tell her that you miss her and love her.
coffe, lunch, site seeing, walk, talk, play in the park, museum and move matinee.
what you want is a hooker, you can find that in any corner of the world.
now we do all these things together and i don't know what to do.
if it fails, you will be in trouble.
it had been the best thing for me.
if these coupons apply, try using some of these.
he cheated on me, and it was the worst thing that he could have done.
is he not treating you well? you should be happy.
we really like it when men go out of their way for us and think about us.
perhaps if you give him space, he will eventually return your call.
explain to him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you appear creepy and you look, they will think you are leering.
i do not know about love, but he is certainly attracted to you.
if the guy really respects you, then he will understand.
ask yourself, decide if you can afford to do it, and then go ahead if you would like to.
since he is a superhero, that is the closest thing to being an average man.
sometimes, if the good outweighs the bad, then the difficulties are worth it.
i do not think it is wise to date people from work.
you require a theory class for that.
allow it take its course from there.
what they think about gay marriage or relationships?
so, of course, i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
guys will find you attractive, no matter what.
do not think that by not having sex that he will become unfaithful to you or leave.
the safe rules of internet dating are to talk through email and messenger, and to talk on the phone.
marraige is about trust and communication.
i have had this problem too.
it depends on what you kissed.
it depends on if you were previously able to trust him.
ensure that you do not make her hate you merely so that you may explain your point.
where have you been meeting these filipino women?
imagine if it was merely considered love.
if you say it that way, you are not telling them specifically what you do not like about them.
if he is single, go for it.
see if she is avaliable for dinner and a movie.
i apologize, but i do not know. i wish the both of you luck.
i find him looking at me every now and then.
it is a sin. we have to start this, ourselves.
fun includes eating meats, and i do not mean breakfast.
make a kind move, if there is not response, you know what to do.
let him make the first move. if you do that, you may look like you are obsessed with him.
you should not get married.
our tragic love story is simply that we loved each other substantially.
you will never find a significant other, if you appear to be despondent.
he asserts that we are only friends.
looks do not really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
once you have sex with him, he'll no longer be a good friend.
when a man is self centered, that's a great turn off.
don't rush it. feel your emotions come alive.
it is a two way traffic until you get them. you will know which one it is.
so, you have one baby out of wedlock?
i know i am overly picky about people. how do i stop that?
it hurts, a lot. maybe some women may say that is it?
i am going to fight that man, is that the right choice?
it was a good idea after all.
it does not turn her off if she gets intoxicated.
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear.
although it may be off-topic, i would prefer to be left alone by them.
ask her to do something that interests her or to a film she would like to see.
you are a man. however, i use that term with levity.
that is amusing. it is unfortunate that it is not automatic as msn and aol are.
and that is how they will react to it so yes, it is a bad situation for you and him.
return to that person immediately before it is too late.
i am laughing because i too would like to cause her smile to depart by means of assault.
ask if he would like to dance with you.
she might say, "that it is ugly, i think prefer this color."
tell him to visit a doctor.
i never went out with him again.
to begin with, why did the two of you break up?
go ahead and do it. there is no use in waiting.
no one else's opinion matters as long as he does not mind.
i think i am still in love with him.
after that time, i never wanted to have sex again.
the important thing is to not try to get revenge on the one who wronged you.
if you need to ask others, then i really do not think that you are ready to.
i am a girl and i say those things.
a big area of savings is flowers.
time will tell; try it for six months and see what the outcome is.
either that, or you are the only person he has a chance to be with.
from the list you compiled, i would have picked spiderman.
my partner cheated on me for three years.
all seniors believe freshman girls are easy, it is unfortunately true though.
you can tell him if he says yes.
you can impress her with love and affection.
what was it like?
you should celebrate valentines day with joy and fun. give eachother gifts and have fun.
any women besides the ugly men will look attractive.
when i moved in my neighbor asked me out.
you should probably make a move because he is obviously shy.
it is just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
be yourself and say hello, and you might get a response.
there are many times that you love the guy but are not sure he loved you also.
if you are talking about my husband i would say tools, toys for his vehicle, and sports related things.
that got me really hot, but i left.
i will pick up the tab if i can get your vote for best answer.
ok, so what breast size does the average guy like?
many twenty-two-year-old women are dating twenty-seven-year-old men, so the men their age feel insecure and have to fish downstream.
lust less, and simply try dating?
they probably know that you cannot really hide, but you should tell your parents.
i will make you a princess on the planet krypton!
before we met, my last girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her, and she still stayed with him.
my friend has a boyfriend whom she talks to online and over the telephone.
do you like false nails or manicured ones?
tell her, girls like to hear the truth; best of luck.
we are able to wrestle around and be the best of friends.
stay true to your husband, after all he is the person who you said "i do" to.
do not listen to these fools with all of their nonsense.
i am a guy so i do not really have to pay.
remember that no bird ever flew with one wing.
just let her know what you feel.
it depends on whether you truly love him. if you do, then you might want to acknowledge it.
if either one of you is married, then you have to run.
men do not, only little boys.
please help me win this debate with her.
my girlfriend is the zealous person i know, and i love her more for it.
the answer is to play with it.
you need to let him go. if you are meant to be, he will come back to you.
after _num_ days of work, my hurt my back.
get your old life back so you can stay alive.
that is the reason why i asked if men ever know what they want in a relationship.
perhaps you should ask him out to lunch, movie, or something similar.
women do not like men that are only about themselves.
it depends on whether you like either one or not.
i kept looking and always picked the imbeciles.
one does what feels comfortable to them. so, no, i feel it is a choice.
some do not have it in them, but some do.
do what makes you happy.
for some reason, i cannot.
so, it would have to be love.
because...you know...try to search your love, but be careful!
do not ask her to perform some act for you. make her the spotlight.
girls are impressed when you simply show them a little care, respect, and honesty.
tell the jerk to get out!
they think it is the only right way!
keep it cool, and good luck!
that said, you have to figure out if you want to stay married to him.
and for that, i hate him.
men like this typically become wife beaters, if you do not obey them!
first of all, i have four children, so i know being a homemaker is more work than my actual job is.
no i have not, i prefer normal-looking men.
he, definitely appears to have feelings for you. you should show him how you feel.
everything seem to be so open. it is hit-an-miss with do many people these days.
maybe i told this man too much, my quandary is unloading all my baggage up front.
choosing the right date can save much money.
if you truly love your new man and want to work things out, then tell your ex to respect that.
that quality makes her easier to lie in bed with.
i don't think you should try doing that.
the concept is simple. treat them honestly and with love.
i am hoping for atleast _num_, but realistically i think it is more like _num_-_num_
but cuddling up with a large woman is one of the best feelings i know.
and women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
a couple of ways would include getting him drunk.
the problem is not if you ask her while at work or not.
stick with the thirteen and fourteen year old teenagers, they are easier to control. good luck.
you should never let a man mistreat you.
post script: i am not a stay-at-home romantic type of woman.
when i left him, i swore i would never marry again!
pickup lines are tacky. be yourself and complement her often, women like that.
you will be fine, just have fun!
not all the time. sometimes men chave them, it depends on the woman.
i love him, but i think i am ready to move on and meet new men!
so wait another four years.
i hope i see some of it soon.
i do not want to be mean.
also, you should wait awhile before having children.
i would enjoy having some fun with you, that is why i answered this ridiculous question.
attempt to contact their q&a team, they will assist you, have a wonderful day!
because women do not have sexual relations often...
if he insists it means that he is only after intimacy.
looks absolutely matter, any person saying that they do not is more than likely fibbing.
while "making love" seems to be a fantasy.
when you are _num_ or _num_ because when they say things they are insincere.
when possible, attempt to make it yourself.
but (there is always a "but," is there not?)
if she is not interested in you any longer.
i sincerely doubt that you are in love with that many men.
i would estimate an average of _num_ initially but then, once you become acquainted with the person, perhaps _num_
participate in sports with your male friends.
she will inform you if it is not acceptable.
i did not intend to ask "do you think women are sexually attractive and beautiful?"
how can i get him to stop pestering me?
buy a toy specifically for intercourse that you both would enjoy.
bald men look like children to me, i don't find it attractive.
i agree, kiss him, and he will have a response for you.
something you can o is imagine your life with out him or her.
here in america, it is not very important...
well, if it was prior to you, then he was not cheating at all, obviously.
how many times i let a great opportunity go from worrying about some person telling me no...
because the white females are taking all of the men!
your reputation is also very important.
have you ever received a pap smear?
wow, how many years of age are you?
but i believe that they both have affection for me.
okay, well, first, it sounds as if you two are already married.
yes, jaime is going to ask rubi to go steady, but it is not your business..
that is a sign, conditions like that, can make it really obvious.
you should take the time to get to know both of them, equally, without going out with either of them.
thank you, i would love to hear some logical opinions on this matter.
if you like the man, then go for it.
having fun with male friends is alright.
so, it is natural with that man.
women take on a lot, and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i am not married, yet.
let me know what you think. thank you.
if you are a homosexual, be yourself.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
i like older girls, so i believe that it is disturbing and wrong that they can not go out with her.
i am curious about everyone's thoughts.
my last boyfriend i met while driving around a roundabout in a different car.
if you do, then you are going to loose your friend over a man.
i said it casually, i do not think he would remember.
are you a country woman or a city woman?
you can try hanging out all day long together and then you can top it off by giving him a foot massage.
i am very disinterested with being single and sitting back watching the other women have all of the pleasure.
females have curiousity regarding sex with other females, myself included!
i have no idea what your remarks were since my excessive laziness prevented me from reading what you'd typed.
i despise it personally. i adore the variety that's straight.
this is doc izzy, and i love big women!
there are no words that will make it better.
do it before it is too late.
well, to tell you truth you will have to do it to learn.
navy pier is a great place, or a museum. there are many great restaruants and hotels.
that is a stereotype. i would like to inform you that i am a rural woman. i think i am sexually attractive in my own way.
he will not reject you.
i hope that you read this very carefully.
many men like women who are heavy. most of them are black.
if she is interested then she will telephone you later.
no, you will not, because you know he has cheating tendencies.
ask yourself that, if you know what i mean.
i find that if i try hard, i can see things i know are not there, that normally is.
let us get coffee and chat. we will take it from there.
move on with your life and find someone else.
i believe you are not ready for a relationship, but email me at atilikethickchix@yahoo.com and i will be honest with you.
i have been dating a boy on and off since last year.
i really care about you and cannot stop thinking about you when we are apart.
it is worth the wait, when you are ready.
if you don't know the answer, ask someone who would know.
keep your fear at bay and tell him.
that is a chance that you are going to have to take.
so drink up, if you want to be attractive to deadbeats, vagabonds, and deviants.
not good for anything besides looking at.
after a while, it passes and i still love him.
as you said, it is your own life.
and now, i am stuck with it, despite my divorce!
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend, does not mean that he is.
sure, let me know more about you.
it is frustrating when one minute you would like to beat-up the person and the next minute you want to have sex with them.
the girls who are pretty or have a great personality.
people whose parents will take care of them are very lazy people.
i do not know what it is that she wants.
it seems very complicated; could you please explain it again in simple terms?
show her what you do well at.
if you can imagine him as the father to your children!
if you do not ask, another person might.
haha, that is why i am not seeing anyone!
you would let him go if you like him.
try to be friendly to here even if she says she does not want to be with you.
believe him if he tells you he is not that way.
let us try to overcome feeling stalled out.
i was employed there for some time and met the man of my dreams.
i have been with my husband for four years. we recently married, in december of _num_
focus on the reality of the circumstances and consider what would be best for you at the moment.
you will find that no matter how hurt you are, the simplest things will still cause you to smile.
i did not realize that pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop immediately because i am ready to relieve myself.
no matter what you decide to do, do not advise him too soon.
we cannot know whether she is sincere.
i do not find a man appealing who behaves that way frequently.
when that occurs, your decision will be easier to make.
i have had intercourse with many women and some were prostitutes.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores two points.
speak with your best friend and determine if it is agreeable.
is this a misleading question?
i do not know. can i do anything about it?
people are married for a reason.
if he does not go out with you, do not worry as there are plenty of other options.
do you just want to say that?
if you are not happy, fix it or get out.
not all men, but some do.
i completely agree with udaman. good luck girl.
sounds like you enjoy selling yourself too much.
your girlfriend will think you are a dolt.
you have to observe the one you call yours.
are you replaying everything you ever did to me?
do not sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
i dated a guy this last year and he became violent.
you need to leave it alone, she in in enough pain.
how could any one person know if they do not know anything about you?
just locate one that loves you too.
it never harms anyone to flirt a little!
we were all having a get together.
don't use pick up lines, they don't work.
i love them because i am a man, and i don't need to ask to dance.
there a plenty of men that are attracted to larger women.
women who complain about receiving flowers are ungrateful.
you need to be with that person because you have found your true love.
i mean really be her friend.
how do i get my sweetheart to show me that he loves me?
basically you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
they have never met but she says that they are in love.
do not do this via phone, e-mail, etc.
i am not against homosexual people and they are the best friends a person can have.
i met a woman and i want to know how to know if she is interested in me.
death is just an unfortunate end.
try to make the best out of a bad situation.
you should either move on, or work it out with your partner.
she is the love of my life, i can't wait to spend the rest of my days with her.
women think with their brains.
i am still in love with my ex and feel angry at my cousin as i believe my ex is attracted to her.
only time will tell. spend time with friends and enjoy yourself, do not think about it.
that is why i do not go to chat rooms anymore, unless it is for entertainment.
this is what i did. it was a mistake.
i do not know where to begin.
he cheated. i can lift or carry my husband.
if she is calling to ramble on, inform her not to call you as often.
that is all i have to say.
you should not be asking this question.
i was also considering lime green.
i mean the both of you together.
i have a close female friend.
they want to be someone else?
can you imagine yourself in bed with him at night?
i love it because of the challenge.
fair skinned women have a tendency to look paler when their hair is black.
wow, i ought to do that the next time that i am dating.
do not listen to anyone else's advice.
i really care for this man and i do not know whether it is a mere attraction or if i love him.
i think "the bomb" is much simpler.
it is not always the easiest choice but they have been fairly satisfying years.
do not forget to choose and vote for best answer.
you tell her why you like her.
did i become homosexual or is it curiosity?
no, not if you must ask.
the list could continue for some time.
however, he may enjoy all of the waiting, dreaming and flirting.
do not eat in the same place you defecate.
certainly. if you do want to chat you can get in touch with me at fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com.
when he teases you about stupid little things.
if you think he feels the same way about you, why not?
in my experience, most of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
they are often worse than men.
i have heard of friends getting married after _num_ months of being together.
i do not know what you mean.
if you want kids, then be a homemaker.
what is the worst that could happen?
a girl with intellect is just plain sexy!
it is about his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and physical activity.
yes, and i also would like you to pay mine.
i can simply say yes and mention that i an proud and have long black hair.
i am not going to let her win.

the song i liked went like this.
do not try to have sex.
you should play a little hard to get.
i believe you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.

if you are also very attractive you should show him your breasts.
there are a lot of males who are like that, only looking for sex.
i mess up a lot at times and she does not forget.
unless you are very desperate wait for him to ask you out.
you are asking do you like me?
whatever you decide, you make it completely yours.
her parents? you cannot fix it. her friends? perhaps you can speak to them nicely, but please specify as to why?
how intoxicated will this girl be?
women love men with a positive self-image.
i am only doing this for the points.

if you do, then i would say that it is real and worth a relationship; i wish you luck.
if you are used to it and you sort of like it, go forward with it.
it's buy one take one.

i do. it is much more pretty and smooth as silk!
however, flowers are really nice even if they do not last.
it sounds like he is enjoying himself too much while you are away.

just relax and be cool.

of course he wants to go on.
so i guess my pick is domestic goddess.
after class, ask her out again.
people, life is too short! live it to the fullest, and have faith!
i am a man, and i feel this as well, because i am as well!
if you like him that much, then phone him!
start with a simple common question and proceed from that point.
tell more people, as my brother did.

do not fall for the alcoholic, only on the weekends line is a sign.
you have stuck yourself out there to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
i prefer a and b cups, myself.
be her friend first and then see where that leads.
do not even listen to what people (not only men) say, observe how they behave.
do you feel that way?
however, if a man asks you, do not be afraid to say no.
obviously, she does not want to be with you if you know that she is interested in another boy.
there are many things that deter women from sex.
not all gentlemen break up with their woman.
your best friend is a good choice to marry in nobody else works out.
are you looking for friendship?
i do this with my current boyfriend.
it does not mean you can not love another.
you need to divorce the guy, he has no honor and does not love you.
men want to have a girlfriend for the free sex.
if nothing works, you have to ask him for it again.
it is your personality that will attract a guy. it should not determine how you act.
you will have to find an answer yourself.
you will not need to prove anything if the guy is worthy enough.
what should i do? i do not want to be like that.
you ought to comparison shop for invitations as well as everything else.
he then asked me, "may i come with you?"
if you're honestly attracted to her, go with your emotions.
i'm only myself around men i'm not attracted to. i'm sure you understand the outcome.
i hope you find a kind women.
i have been attracted to this women since i was in ninth grade.
to my fellow females at cone, hi and a great embrace!
there is a reason that she likes him.
if going to a movie, is special for the two of you, then you should do that.
it sounds like you are the boss.
have you ever told her that it is a rather annoying that she checks up on you everyday?
it goes the other way too; think girls prefer slender and toned gentlemen.
he gave me his cellphone so i could put my number in it.
either go to hawaii or pay someone.
why do people frown on this topic?
you will find "mrs. right."
if you are planning to be unfaithful to your wife then you are disgusting and should be shot.
he already knows that you care for him. has he said anything about it?
confront him and ask him so that you will know.
it is more of an issue of trust, in my opinion.
never stop trying to impress her.
no, you are being punished. no television for one month.
i believe this is better than the one on top of me.
but that did not bother me because, as i said, we were merely friends.
go to school; you can still come home or call your family and friends.
you should choose the one who chooses you because, nine times out of _num_, he likes you.
i always felt similarly, but after i met my true love, my views changed.
take baths? know how to speak?
i like him and he makes statements such as, "if i were single, i would date you."
leave him and you will be better off.
the one time in your life to live out the fantasy of love.
people asked me, "what's the hurry?"
has he broken up with a woman and abandoned her in the past?
i am now thirty-six years old and still in therapy because of it.
and for heaven's sake, do not become one of thos controlling baby mamas.
did you ever think of that?
it has been _num_ months and i wonder if it is normal for me to still like him.
look for a sexy man.
it really is sweet and just what you are looking for.
is there an excuse that you are not with the father of the child?
no! it definitely is very bad. you are simply wasting your health because girls just dislike it.
anything that is larger than a handful is a waste, more than likely a size c or d.
i myself believe that they do.
cease attempting to slap it in every persons face!
you should be searching in a public place. wherever you are most comfortable.
a man asked me, "do you mind if we cuddle?".
questioning the score of last game?
some couples never get to the comfortable, boring stage.
i always say that you shouldn't do something you will regret later.
even the next day would probably work.
all you need to do now is smile.
the same situation has happened to me as well.
although, i do not really like women all that much.
be very nice, give eye contact, and smile a lot. i hope this helps.
i would wonder why he shaved them, but in the end, they are his legs.
best of luck to both of you.
this is merely what i have heard many times.
i prefer anything natural over false. i even hate the word "false."
no, ten years younger. who would want an older woman?
ask your best friend if it would be fine.
many people will tell you "no."
i like to go dancing at clubs in downtown huston.
who said that women do not feel anything?
do not start with how she looks.
if they have moved on, then you should, too.
flirt, and see how he responds.
i am waiting until i get married. when do you think that will go too far?
there is nothing wrong with her taking you phone number.
you do not have to be a overly, jubilant, hyper-active person.
i do not want to randomly go up and ask them to go out with me.
then comes the fun part, him making it up to you.
foreplay is important and should last, at the bare mininum, five minutes.
i cannot assist any further without more information.
because i say no on avatars.
some women prefer non-perishable gifts which are long-lasting.
he probably wants to know if you're interested in him.
i feel silly, strange, and exuberant.
if you're promiscuous, then he is as well.
some men only say that word, if they mean it.
i don't need a high maintenance woman, i want a companion
as a man, i want to say something.
be confident, and always believe in yourself. don't be arrogant. make great eye contact. listen to her.
after he asked, "do you want to use some of my chapstick?".
there are no directions to kissing.
we love them, it isn't until later that we regret what we have done.
i don't believe i have an answer, because i myself am in the same predicament.
what was the mistake you made?
it is akin to breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem psychotic, because you have to know one another for awhile.
yes, for the first answer. the woman answered for me.
what about blue or green?
a life that belongs to you alone, a life you have been missing out on.
that is confusing. yes, i think you are correct.
the answer is that you do not have to invite her on a date in order to go on a date with her.
possibly he will call you.
okay, speak to her, but be as polite as possible.
i lost my virginity in a park when i was sixteen.
what man does not like large breasts?
you should be very pleased with yourself.
yeah, males work and repair things, but what other things can you accomplish?
we are unaware of what you look like.
if you could have four qualities in a woman, what would they be?
if you search the internet, local newspapers, or watch the news, you can find a lot of things for weddings.
if she sits on your friends lap due to intoxication, then yes, it is a turn off.
do you see my partner?
you will find a man that deserves you.
i like the perfume that you wear.
if you are not ready, then forget him.
why do they want it sanctioned by the state?
she lets me work on my trucks and watch cartoons.
you can still love him, just move on.
see if he is willing to go out of the way for you.
if anyone knows, please let me know.
i never knew that life could be so exceptional.
also, he said that he would call me back.
chose the one whom you like the most.
turn off your pop up blocker.
if you honestly love him then you will tell him.
i would absolutely enjoy that happening to me.
what should i do to attract her attention?
my friend, you have to seize the opportunity and introduce yourself.
there are movies that i have not seen yet.
i believe that it all depends on age and nurturing.
that will be just intercourse.
my significant other was definitely my friend first. that makes it complete euphoria.
who cares what anyone else thinks.
try getting some blonde highlights.
find a medium that works in order to vent.
make her a mix tape or cd.
what is you choice of the options and why?
do not worry about what others say.
many women enjoy getting flowers.
i cannot explain it; however, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable, or submissive.
you should either let him go or date his brother.
they do exist; you simply have to look.
you can purchase them at staples for _num_
your child is going to have hard enough time growing up without a father.
my friend says that i am too nice and that i should tell them, "no."
my special woman always says that she loves me while we are passing notes during class, but she does not say it confrontationally.
that is correct, the right relationship happened all on its own.
you will look like an imbecile.
if you admire him, then you should not care, stay with him.
i think you should be true to yourself and have self-esteem and self-confidence.
anything that cannot be easily moved.
if you really want to keep company with her that much, than you have to make it your top priority.
my older sister had a relationship with one of my best friends, a few months ago.
should i just forget and move on?
on the other hand, their friends are a different story.
absolutely, i do think that anyone would.
my cousin met up with an outlandish mature deviant, that she met online, he had told her that he was a salacious teenager.
none are on my list so i select my neighbor's wife.
i have long black hair and both my husband and i are quite fond of it.
if you care for your family then everyone in your family will love you.
unattractive and overweight men simply accept what they are able to get.
in the middle of the river while people were watching. it was actually fairly amusing.
it is all in the eye contact.
it depends on the man, some do, some do not.
it is giving us the idea that you may not have fortitude.
if you love each other, then he may want to disappoint his father.
absolutely, some men get right down to it with absolutely no thought for the woman.
perhaps she is not a shrew, but the thin woman definitely was.
it does sound a hint adolescent.
if you want an enjoyable date, check out a few restaurants, night clubs, gyms, etc.
there are a lot of good women out there, you just have to look in the correct places.
hello, everyone is going to separate some day.
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, just be careful next time.
happy birthday to you!
i need someone to help me understand this.
pick the one that you feel will be the best treatment for you.
i am interested in a boy in the _num_ grade too!
i do not date my guy friends, beaause if you break up, you might not be friends anymore.
you need to do more then make eye contact.
what is best for the both of you?
he had bad teeth, bad breath, and body odor.
no one needs to know that information.
if i am to ask, i will then leave and stop the relationship. then i would move on with my life.
do not take it the wrong way.
i asked him if he still liked me. he said yes, but he did not act like it.
where am i going with this?
keep getting her younger and younger, and when one gets old you get a new one to replace her.
you would know that if you did not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean it makes it right, it just means that it makes us human.
it is a mistake that cannot be reversed.
practice unwrapping starburst with your tongue, and tying cherry stems with your tongue.
you caught her looking at you?
i know of three men that i can probably get away with doing something like that.
tell her that you are attracted to her and then ask her to go out with you.
if he is going to be an 'on and off' man, then i would say to break up with him permanently.
if they do not, then you will have to continue on with your life.
i have never been there.
compliment her, ask her name, act like yourself and like you are the most dapper guy ever.
she calls him frequently.
how should i approach her, without her thinking i'm just another man with bad intentions?
wait for a little bit, and then date other men that you enjoy spending time with.
someone who is never judgmental because they believe is cool, is usually judgmental.
you don't have any power to make that decision.
i know, so why should i be forced to conceal it?
some guys do not like to dance.
she is not your friend if she will not stop bugging you.
i wish i listened to my friends.
after how much time can you conclude that she is not interested?
do i desire to be in love?
why do they desire to be married?
easy, oh, and brilliant photograph of george clooney on your profile, haha.
some women cannot seem to locate males their own age that are attractive.
some may, but i would otherwise have a pair that were not too large.
it sounds as though you are both comfortable with things as they are.
very sexually attractive. yes, it looks very nice on most any woman.
sometimes it is better to be friends first and ensure that you are happy around each other.
my question is: will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill's song "love ain't like that." it is a very good example.
please do not ask that question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
and if she loves you, your girlfriend should accept that.
i think it is very sexy when a man shaves his legs.
i do not think it is the best thing for you two to stay in touch.
i'm fond of this boy, austin, and i informed my companion, claudia, to inquire as to whether or not he feels the same toward me.
you are murdering the romantic behavior by asking that inane query. alternatively, have you considered partaking in enjoyable activities as a couple?
he has a player position. no skills, believe me.
it's dependent upon other things. they're all fond of various selections, however, not self-involved reprobates such as yourself!
in my opinion, it's terrific; perhaps the initial turn should be yours to take!
if he rejects you, he was not worth it to begin with.
just walk up to her.
it is wise to always be honest. besides, i do not know many guys who dislike complements!
they know women will not pursue them like they would a handsome or wealthy man, they get loads of women.
ask him if he would like to go to the movies with you.
that is what is known as, sexual intimacy.
smile towards him occasionally, then he will start to get the picture.
most women are polite, so she'll answer your question.
you sound very similar to my best friend, so i would.
say hello and ask him when he is taking you to dinner.
it really depends on the man, but i think most men really do not care.
it will work out if you want it to.
if he does not want to dance, then give it up.
but you know, i think it is up to the man to make the first move.
unless it is with a boyfriend, it is acting a bit like a slut.
take it from a military woman and wait!
they never show affection except when they want something.
i am _num_ years old and seeking a beautiful woman to spend some time with and maybe more.
do you mean to seem more sexy?
if you check in the deleted items it should be there.
i wonder if this may be a red flag about the way this man is.
no offence but perhaps because your name is "freakgirl" but if you were to show your face perhaps not.
that would be very painful, trust me i have done it.
do you love her deeply?
enjoy yourself in prison, asking that question of your cellmate.
no, the only time a man will be emotional is in the presence of his female lover.
yes, i have done it. it was very entertaining.
you must tell the person with whom you are in a relationship what you want.
of course, if she calls about that five times a day, that would be ridiculous.
wait for the one that will appreciate you for you.
my mother books trips at "pat@alanatvl.com"
he probably has many things to worry about right now other than you.
i have been in a relationship with a man that is younger than me.
men play with love to get sex, women play with sex to get love.
it has to be overplayed after a while.
everyone enjoys compliments on their appearance, even if they do not admit it.
yes, it depend upon the man.
perhaps it's because you believe they appear sexy when they are running.
you're too young to be speaking about kissing.
i probably will inform her soon. she's my best friend. any assistant would be great.
i agree with the other individual. before anybody gets injured.
i love him, but i am also ready to move on.
you should go out and do everythign you could not when you were with them.
men are not much better.
you would have to tell him that you only want to be friends with benefits.
play a game of truth or dare together.
he sounds like a real manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace and maybe try some foreplay.
death is like a big black bag full of crack cocaine, smack, or methadone.
do you want to practice kissing me? where do you live?
no, you will not, dear, because i was married to a total jerk.
it sounds like you really love her so you do not have to forget her.
tell him that you just want to be friends and that you are really sad that he would act so silly.
things always come out in the open, so do not do it.
also, i am disgusted by chest hair and do not understand the appeal.
at the moment, i think he is angry, upset and unwilling to be with you.
give your brother some money and inform him that he ought to leave.
i do not intend offense but that sounds like a woman's name.
remain calm and ask her on a date.
after you take her on a date, get to know her better then ask her to be in a relationship with you.
people do not enjoy being played with as though they were a yo-yo.
practice being able to unwrap starburst candies with your tongue. women enjoy it.
i do not know. i merely want the points.
that is not entirely true, it is just that most women are discreet in reference to it...
that depends, are you an attractive individual with an athletic form?
i let him know it was too late, other than that, it would not have bothered me to receive flowers once in a while.
believing in it is an odd way of putting it.
why can't men or boys ever speak the word love?
just enjoy the age you are and don't worry about other things.
i am _num_ years old, but like anyone up to age _num_
i had a friend who was in the same situation.
trust me, girls can be just as perverted.
you should not date a guy because you need to.
what you are saying is she does not want to be more than boyfriend and girlfriend?
does it generally take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship?
i knew all my former girlfriends were not the one until i met my wife.
if you do not base your relationship on intercourse, then it is ok.
some men would do that, why?
if you are an average guy, breast size should not matter.
stay far away from men who cannot say, "i love you."
ask for permission first, and watch how fast she slap the stuffing out of you.
my husband adores me, for me.
this just hits too close to home for me, my mother also, has cancer.
be your best self. if he is impressed he will want to talk.
you do not want anyone else but that specific person.
why not try chatting or seeing other men to see how he reacts?
but it is fine to kiss on the first date.
males have an issue with secrets.
i had someone become quite horrible with me because i continued dating.
so, how do i simply kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister, and i desire it to be pefect.
unless, it is with the incorrect male.
i mean that you have to really be her friend.
are you posing a rhetorical question?
men pretend to love in order to have intercourse; women pretend to enjoy intercourse in order to get love.
i do not intend to be mean.
i would estimate an average of _num_ initially but then, once you become acquainted with the person, perhaps _num_
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear.
let us purchase coffee and converse and proceed from that point!
also, i dislike it when my father is unhappy.
ask him if you should go see a doctor.
you can post more questioins on yahoo! answers.
he probably has many things to worry about right now other than you.
but i do not believe that he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of intercourse.
will i always feel that way?
however, he may enjoy all of the waiting, dreaming and flirting.
also, i would like to try again.
some men shave, it depends on the woman.
well, if you are really attracted to this guy, then smile and speak nicely to him.
i am not certain whether he loves you, but he definitely likes you.
i would invite you on a date but i live in oregon and i am entirely uniformed as to where you live.
i realize i am overly selective when it comes to people; how can i stop this?
doing that does sound rather feminine.
sometimes, if the good outweighs the bad, then the difficulties are worth it.
that is if both of you agree to do this.
one female, michelle, who most likely would not being mentioned, stated that she did not believe in it.
well, why do you like the one boy who picks on you?
in addition, men sometimes think that they do not need you that badly until you are gone.
alas, if a male inquires of you, do not be frightened to state negatively.
do i desire to be in love?
that's the name i applied to it. for what reason, though?
they will think you are leering if you look at them creepily.
i think that you are right, it is confusing.
how do i get my significant other to show me that he loves me.

in my opinion, they do.
it is a wrong decision that cannot be undone!

i never knew that life could be so exceptional.
all right, i am very, very into this one man and i'm unaware as go his feelings in return.
what is best for the both of you?
at least she didn't give you a fake number.
therefore, in my opinion, you are not promiscuous.

tell me your opinion. thank you.
i would suggest not worrying about it overmuch.
what is the worst thing that could occur?
i am confused and do not know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way.
you should find someone who does not hate you.

it depends on if you were previously able to trust him.

twenty to thirty-two is fine and she does not have to be younger than you.
the concept is simple. treat them honestly and with love.
when that occurs, your decision will be easier to make.
phrases to initiate a romance are tawdry. be genuine and compliment her often. women like that.

it is just the way things are.
it is ok to be friends with someone online, but there should be limits.

i know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home.
get away from it all, go enjoy a massage.
i do not know where to start.
that depends, are you an attractive individual with an athletic form?
are you referring to your avatar?
you can try hanging out all day long together and then you can top it off by giving him a foot massage.
if a man cares about you, then he will call.
if your behavior is always as it is now, she may come to believe you're in a state of desperation.
in my opinion, there is a large difference between 'having intercourse' and 'making love.'
first of all, i have four children, so i know being a homemaker is more work than my actual job is.
you don't need to stay together, even if you have a child.
are you a young woman from a rural environment or from an urban environment?
getting married and having children can be postponed, but your studies cannot be.
i have never attended it.
do you want to be in a relationship with the same man?
how often can you have sexual relations with pamela anderson?

i am referring to the two of you collectively.
the right woman will come along if you are patient.
i desire my wife to grow as well.
he is obviously shy, perhaps you should make a move.
the doctor was surprised as well.
should you have fun with the pair of them simultaneously, she'll most likely have rough sex with you.
where do you live? i could come over and you could practice kissing me.
maybe you believe it is a no, but it is a yes.
no offence but perhaps because your name is 'freakgirl' but if you were to show your face perhaps not.
men do not, only little boys.
maybe ask if they would like to go on a date sometime soon.
it happenned to me, twice.
you should not go out with a man because you feel the 'necessity' to.
you would not be asking, if you really wanted to be with him.
and i just pray that it never passes!
most women are waiting for a man to tell her his true feelings.
women are more passionate during sex.
continuously attempt to impress her.
leaning towards me and kissing me gently on only the forehead.
i am not that type of person, however i know plenty of people like that.
she's concerned only about herself. no, that should not occur on a primary outing.
okay, it depends on how deeply you are starting to experience emotions for this boy!
in advance, thank you for the pep.
why do they desire to be married?
we like to be approached softly, with some slight chasing.
in any event, i married my husband, and wonder if you know the reasons in addition to love.
i would like a trip to an amusement park, or a museum.
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love.
do you enjoy fake nails or manicured nails?
first, plan what you desire and do not worry about what everyone else desires.
now we do all of these things together. i don't know what i should do.
i do not understand you.
i asked him if he still liked me. he said he does but does not act that way.
i like the perfume that you wear.
practice being able to unwrap starburst candies with your tongue. women enjoy it.
i think most men do not care, but it does depend on the individual person.
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable, young or submissinve.
do not get married so early in the relationship.
you are not a good person of you plan to be unfaithful to your wife.
be the best version of yourself, and if he is impressed he will talk to you.
you don't want to be with anyone, but that person.
he is getting married, stop pursuing it.
did you relay to her the annoying nature of her daily check-ins with you?
when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor.
most teen-aged boys prefer teen girls like enjoy fornication.
he played a good game of basketball.
are you someone who enjoys arguing and fighting?
if his affections tended away from her and toward you, he likely would've terminated the romance to be with you.
the most important issue, is not attempt to retaliate at the individual that wronged you.
one man willing to move twenty-one hours and fourteen hundred miles just to be with me.
have you seen a doctor yet?
perhaps she is not a shrew, but the thin woman definitely was.
you should pursue an active life and not waste my time.
it is comparable to over-indulging in chocolate and then complaining because you have gained weight.
i traveled there and he was present.
if he is single, go for it.
if you do not obey men like this, they typically become the sort who beat their wives.
are you or are you not attracted to him?
if you are sure, however, then you should tell your parents is you have not already done so.
many people will probably reject you.
do you believe he has the same feelings towards you?
some men only say that word, if they mean it.
it appears that he likes you, and should should show him how you feel.
i am of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name.
friends are forever because guys come and go.
try to imagine that it was considered love.
i believe you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.
all right, presently certain men like women of that type and others, not as much.
if you want children, then be a homemaker.
younger men and older women, good idea or not?
he wants to continue.
you need to remain faithful to your husband. he is the one the you swore vows to.
therefore, there is no alternative to the proper labeling of 'love.'
also, your self-image is very important.
i say those things and i am female.
trust me, girls can be just as perverted.
flowers are nice, even if the do not last long.
there are films that i have yet to see.
she is a very sweet girl, just the person you are looking for!
try to use your brain and not your manhood, maybe she does not love you.
no disrespect intended; but, that does sound like a lady's name.
i would not take the trouble to call him back.
no women i'm attracted to in my list, therefore i choose my neighbors spouse.
marraige is about trust and communication.
do not listen to anyone else's advice.
what should i do to be successful with her?
give them a rose and express your love for them.
it is unusual, i agree, however it is nothing bad.
you need to see discern what's correct for you both.
they are woman enough for a man, but they aren't as sophisticated as us.
exactly, especially when she became sick.
due to...as you're aware...attempt to look for your beloved...however, use caution!
i cannot assist any further without more information.
kissing is something you cannot do wrong or right.
take time to decide.
enjoying yourself with male friends is acceptable.
merely contemplate those things you enjoy and provide the same in return, somewhat akin to a massage performed with one's tongue.
my significant other was definitely my friend first. that makes it complete euphoria.
i would say, that it is more of a trust issue.
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out.
then move on if he still does not like you.
he probably isn't interested either.
try to make it yourself whenever possible.
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
i told her i sincerely loved her.
it seems that all of the male senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which unfortunate.
so, how do i simply kiss him?
if you check in the deleted items it should be there.
i hope that you find a nice girl to date.
i do not believe that is a good idea, you are not there for that purpose.
it is a very long list.
i would say brokeback mountain; you will be happy even if it is a man.
if you do not base your relationship on intercourse, then it is ok.
i will most likely inform her soon because she is my best friend. in any case, any help would be appreciated.
correct, also it is a portender of misfortune to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
um, modest get-together for relatives.
if you are skeptical about the performance piece of it, then do not do it.
i am married now.
i believe it is completely dependent upon age and upbringing.
once you have children, you will need to decide on a last name.
your child will find it difficult enough growing up without a father.
bald men look like children to me, i don't find it attractive.
you should give it a chance. if you end up breaking up with that person, it will be harder to be friends with them.
ask what the score of the last game was.
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married.
of course, let me get to know you more.
i prefr a size c or d. anythign bigger is a waste.
deceive and mislead and then fabricate some more.
they have not performed previously and the pleasure is twice as nice!
my wife does not like to wear those brands.
we are unaware of what you look like.
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life.
i think this is better than my personal life.
don't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex.
speak with your best friend and determine if it is agreeable.
it sounds strange, but it worked for me, in about three to five days.
i do not like it when he teases you about the little things.
no, because i am not yet married.
a large number of males appreciate heavyset women; they are primarily african american.
i most enjoy expressing my feelings to women with poems. has anyone written one for their significant other?
i've previously communicated my affection to her and she expressed her concern about damaging our relationship as friends.
if you admire him, then you should not care, stay with him.
do they mock you when you are with him?
i adore those people since i'm male and i'm not required to invite a date to the affair.
you should not get married if you feel this strongly about it.
it's strongly dependent on whether or not a person is vain.
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who does not hate you.
you should becom acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
i asked him if he was blowing me off.
perhaps some vulgar young men enjoy the younger asian ladies.
make sure it is your decision.
tell him you are looking to keep it casual.
is he not treating you well? you should be happy.
this situation is a challenging one with lots of problems.
they have been fairly favorable years, not always the easiest.
we have seen each other, everyday, for approximately four to five years.
imagine that i am the man you want, and then date me.
it never harms anyone to flirt a little!
you should stick with what you feel inside.
i wish you luck.
is it bad if i have not kissed the girl i have been with for eight months?
it is the woman's decision.
i believe they look better than many other nations.
it would be ok the day after.
see if she is avaliable for dinner and a movie.
some men don't think of their partner when they just get to it.
please ask the question in english; i am unable to understand you.
i apologize, but i have never felt that way.
remember, no bird has ever tried to fly with one wing.
i frequently think about this issue.
you will never find a significant other, if you appear to be despondent.
i met agirl recently, and i want to know if she likes me.
do not simply sit around and wait for the phone to ring.
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation that you wish.
many twenty-two-year-old women are in relationships with twenty-seven-year-old men, so the twenty-two-year-old men feel insecure and search for younger women.
if he comes to his senses, great; if not, you should move on.
he may love you, but he also may want to disappoint his father.
you will just humiliate yourself if you apologize to him without committing a mistake. do not get weak!
you should take action before it is too late.
this woman doesn't want a man who deceives her.
i'd enjoy hearing the viewpoint of an african american woman regarding this subject.
please help me win this debate against her!
almost without exception (not constantly) those are men similar in age to yourself, more or less.
when will pepole begin to realize this?
i'm unsure concerning what i should do.
you visit a bar and drink until you are inebriated.
i behaved as such in the company of my present romantic partner.
if you have to ask, then that is a negative.
do not sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one.
even though i am getting divorced, i am still stuck with this.
you will be fine. enjoy yourself.
your girlfriend will only think that you are being a jerk.
you can't fix the relationship with her parents, but you may be able to fix the relationship with her friends. why do you ask?
personally now, i would refrain from wedding any female unwilling to relinquish her surname, however, that is merely my feeling.
perhaps you should attempt to pursue young women, given the tendency by men to be offensive.
i went out with my ex for three years and then he/she cheated.
you will know in time, and i recommend seeing what happens for six months.
well, the one i enjoyed goes something like this.
not all gentlemen break up with their woman.
going there is great fun, and there are plenty of things to do.
is it okay to kiss on the first date?
i have a female friend that i am close with.
they lust for each other.
when he does, you should explain to him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break-up.
my friend tells me that i am too nice, and that i should tell him no.
but, because there is always an exception, is there not?
not all men, however some men do.
by doing so, you're still able to retain your surname.
approach her, say hello, and ask if she is single.
that really stimulated me sexually, but i ran away.
girls who are heavier can still be attractive.
not every participant present is attending educational courses.
practice unwrapping starburst and tying cherry stems, with your tongue.
if you keep on talking to him for another week, then he is going to think he is married to you.
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer.
you should look for somewhere in public, where you will feel most comfortable.
flirt with him and gauge his reaction.
and it eases the pressure i'm feeling to invite somebody.
please say you will go out with me.
she does not forget my mistakes.
how should i approach her, without her thinking i'm just another man with bad intentions?
as a man, i may have some insight.
do not worry, you are only _num_
always go trail riding with company.
if the two of you truly love each other, then you will work things out.
eye contact is the key point.
i can lift him.
he simply has to start over, and regain your trust again.
i was with my ex boyfriend in the second grade and then in the fourth grade and then again in the eighth grade.
why do you want to ask her out?
well, i'm hoping you'll review this information very thoroughly.
try playing, 'truth or dare,' together.
wait until you find out and confirm, then go from there.
that is stupid because you need a theory class for that.
just quit if you do eat something like that.
i keep thinking about sex with her.
the only way you will know is if you confront him and ask him directly.
jamie is going to ask rubi out on a date.
the relationship is still happening because neither of you have the courage to end things.
it may be that it is interesting for them to learn about that.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores: two points.
do men truly prefer bigger women?
he loves you as well, but only time can tell what will happen.
if a man really respects you, he will understand you.
we have started our own sins.
his answer works for me.
you can still love him ,but you need to move on.
a woman that is intelligent is a turn-on.
i think it is wrong that they cannot go out with her.
my sister closes her eyes to get ready when she kisses someone.
i met my last boyfriend while i was driving in a roundabout.
he is, however, getting married this month.
should i just let this go and move on?
are you replaying everything that you did to me?
it sounds like you two are already married.
firstly, why was the relationship not terminated?
he may call you back if you give him space.
you should tell more people.
simply proceed one step at a time. consider how he lost a something positive.

the people such as your friends who are around you now should like you regardless.
because they like the breasts and genitals.
if you both feel the same way when you are older, then go for it.
i am not one of those people; but, i know there are plenty of them.
i would assume "no", especially since you have to ask.
you want to suck another man's phallus?
i like to think that women are not as sophisticated as we men are.
does this mean he likes me?
do not worry about him, just focus on school so you can learn.
i know because i dates someone like that.
look at the way she walks.
no, i certainly hope not.
hello, i am interested in visiting your country.
over time, should i give him another chance?
is that the same man you want to have a relationship with?
i went, and there he was.
that is what i had called it, but why?
that way you will still be able to use your last name.
both of you have worked hard to make it right.
i have told her that i like her but she said she would not want to ruin our friendship.
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your naked baby pictures.
it is very important to last at least _num_-_num_ minutes.
but, i am not telling you to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then gang up on him.
i love to run my fingers through curly hair.
i want my wife to grow also.
well, i guess that is just the way it is.
one girl named michelle, who probably does not mind being named, spoke up and said she did not believe in it.
i can just toss him to the side like trash and forget about him; but i am joking.
he was a little busy after that.
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care for him.
if you do eat something like that then you should just quit.
it could be that you need to urinate or it could be the last dream that you had.
if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.
if you were friends before and you have stronger feelings now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangements and flowers you like.
lie, lie, lie and then lie some more.
wait till you find out for sure, then go from there.
he should not really care, if you two are at a dance.
trust him, and do not bring the matter up again.
honestly, most women are just waiting for the man to tell her how he truly feels.
yes, i would love to meet the ladies!
now and again, i actually ponder this one.
i met a very romantic man in a large rainstorm.
some men like women who behave that way and others do not.
it comes after three-play and before five-play.
i feel foolish when i fall in love.
if you must ask, then you are not in love.
if you start to feel something coming on, re-start the four play.
i do not understand the question. would someone please give me the answer.
i saved _num_-_num_ doing my own flowers for my wedding and it was not a hassle.
i just went through a divorce, and he did as well.
ask a girl about those symptoms, because i am a boy.
be yourself, show a bit of toughness, that is what girls like, at least most girls, but above all be yourself.
follow your heart, it is never wrong.
they annoy you all throughout the day.
watch for if he telephones, sends an electronic mail or even cares.
you can attempt a civilian arrest.
usually you feel a spasm in your back.
by now, you may love your wife just for everything the two of you have endured.
i hope that everything works out for you.
tell this person you love them, and then wait for their answer.
attempt to invite her on a date again and observe her response.
there is no way to force a person to fall in love with you.
ask her question; do not merely speak.
when you first fall in love you are giddy, bemused, and light-hearted merely thinking of that person.
and remember that there is more than one.
i just think they look better than a many other nations out there.
once again, we got married!
overall, i do not think that it really matters.
and i am certainly not driving five hours just to spend time with her, unless i really liked her.
how often can you have sexual relations with pamela anderson?
i told her i sincerely loved her.
what good did it do?
i do not like to break another one's heart.
give them a rose and express your love for them.
i like the thick ones because the thin ones make me feel cheated.
remember, "until death do you part".
because we always find a life partner and it is usually someone that is the opposite side of us.
what are you talking about?
if you keep on talking to him for another week, then he is going to think he is married to you.
women do not want that much, just some acknowledgement and occasionally a little help.
that is what it seems like to me.
do no be afraid to say no.
end the relationship, there are always more fish in the sea.
it does not matter to me, though a handful is quite ehough.
choose the one the adores you the most!
you released at least a thousand of them.
you went to a bar and drank too much.
think about it before you act.
you should not leave them but instead teach them what to do better.
bembie got it right.
no, the two of you kiss when you are ready.
user julesac is amusing, but rude.
if you are asking this, then you must have already distanced yourself from her yet remain as a friend.
don't forget to vote for what you think is the best answer!
don't try to figure out the answer, that is just how it is.
i don't know, but i do have another website that i visit.
it depends on how strongly you feel about this man.
he must be very controlling.
everything depends on the individual woman and her level of interest in the man.
search out and attempt new activities in order to meet people.
in most cases there are multiple issues rather than only one.
if you truly care for them.
for the young men: is your preference a larger woman or a petite woman?
if all you do is fight it is not worth it.
what makes it even more horrible is that i already went out with him for four years!
you just need to be patient and the appropriate lady will come along.
if you no longer love your husband and you have a place for another man?
a wife, because you can accomplish more without commiting a sin.
she absolutely desires for you to think she is attractive, but she does not want that to be the number one reason.
it depends, some days i desire to have sexual relations, other days i do not.
also, they are more passionate when they make love.
should you have fun with the pair of them simultaneously, she'll most likely have rough sex with you.
perhaps since you are the most attractive young lady they have ever encountered.
it's strongly dependent on whether or not a person is vain.
a person i'm able to act naturally with.
send me you photograph, and contact me.
stay away from this male friend.
the doctor cannot even believe it.
yes, for sure. especially, when she vomits!
if not, do not sweat it!
i could give you some pointers.
if you feel that you love is fading, do not just sit there and do nothing!
i will not stay with someone that i do not trust.
there was only one time i told a girl i loved her and meant it.
you married him and it was for a reason.
take off your shirt and do a tarzan yell.
yes. down there, do not have sex.
they accept this in their culture.
always ride the trail with a friend.
you did not give us very good information; do you all live in one house?
move on because it does not matter if he is attractive; looks are not everything.
the most important thing is to just be yourself.
you should be disapointed and mad.
i have never felt that way.
i would not like any girl who would make my life difficult.
if he gets the tickets, you get the popcorn.
you can practice, and ask if you are doing good.
if you are positive, then first tell your parents, if you have not already done so, that is.
i met mine at a carnival.
that sounds like a rhetorical question.
i believe that everyone should keep their name.
your initial kiss should feel like you are in heaven.
this situation is a challenging one with lots of problems.
how to keep a woman content.
please abstain from doing things that might be harmful to you.
you will be compensated more if you are willing to work more.
do not approach her and let her know that you find her looks very attractive.
i don't think it's a good idea, you are not there for that purpose.
go up to her and say "hi, are you single?"
i think he would make a great valentine.
just be prepared to let her go.
rather than just sit there and wait, you are a good one.
just tell them, what will they do, slap you?
get away from it all, go enjoy a massage.
well, if you really like this man, smile and talk nicely to him.
take them both out at the same time.
it happened to me and now i am dating that person.
first, plan what you desire and do not worry about what everyone else desires.
you may just be over looking the type of men who think the most of you..
preferrably a person who does not dislike you.
we attempted to move on, but it did not work out.
when will people in this messed up world finally realize this?
i would not bother calling him back.
try not to be around him, and find another guy.
look for another attractive girl, so she will be jealous.
so in my opinion you are not a promiscuous woman.
red equals love, black equals death, etc.
break up with her. if she is attracted to him, then she is not attracted to you. it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, after three days, i might start to forget about you.
find a girl, who is pretty and has talents.
there is no one you can trust more than a good friend!
you could start the day by eating breakfast out, then take a nice walk.
if she says yes, then go pick them up.
if yes is the answer, why did i hear a girl say that flowers will not last?
it may be that it is interesting for them to learn about that.
could it ever be the same?
it is not that bad because at least it is not bella.
could it be because some men are just liars?
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances.
that is a culture that has things right.
my twin will not talk or listen to me.
do you want to get something that you can not get rid of.
i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
i think it would be fine to get a video game.
go after it and take the chance.
if he can not, then perhaps take him on a dinner date to a place where you can slow dance.
i feel that this is the most beautiful part of a family life.
it is your choice not to hate one but i dislike them at the very least.
do not get married without a prenup.
do not waste my life.
did she say you were too good for her?
friends are forever because guys come and go.
it could mean many things.
affirmative, it is commonplace because many people exist who have residual fondness for a former romantic partner.
i'd enjoy hearing the viewpoint of an african american woman regarding this subject.
men are unintelligent! what person understands the meaning behind their behavior?
well, if they delivered to you their contact details, you require no waiting period whatsoever.
because they served as masters of the entire cosmos.
i am in love, and i do not care who knows it, buddy the elf.
and whatever you do, do not try to have both of them at once.
you would not be asking, if you really wanted to be with him.
remember: being friends with someone online is fine, but there are limits.
my sister closes her eyes when she prepares herself to kiss someone.
personally now, i would refrain from wedding any female unwilling to relinquish her surname, however, that is merely my feeling.
um, modest get-together for relatives.
females are sexual deviants. they simply conceal it and behave as such in the company of other females covertly.
also, i've merely made it to grade five, yeah!
what is your desire, however?
please don't do that. it will not work.
if they don't love you, then it is time to move on.
he is everything i wanted with his looks and money.
it is bad look to see the bride in her dress before the wedding ceremony.
she is not a liar.
you can be whoever you are.
he has his nose pierced.
i can lift him.
you would need a therapist for that.
perhaps some sexually deviant men like the very young looking asian girls.
you should probably go and see a psychiatrist.
he is giving you stupid, off-the-wall excuses and acting in ways that he did not before.
be strong and hold on.
no, he is too large and i am too weak.
if she is so intoxicated that she becomes sloppy or uncooth, then yes, it is unattractive.
keep in touch with each other. you can exchange letters, e-mails, online chat, talk over the phone, and send packages.
especially when you don't feel like it.
he dribbles, he shoots, he scores: two points.
having sex to have a male stay with you, is similar to selling your soul to the devil.
i'm unable to give you a wife's view, but hopefully mine is just as well.
as well, it takes the pressure off of me to ask.
it depends upon the woman. i prefer shaved.
ask in proper english. i cannot comprehend your meaning.
i'm a man. i'll inform you what i'm aware of.
i enjoy passing time with him. i want to win him over, not push him away.
all right, i am very, very into this one man and i'm unaware as go his feelings in return.
by the by, the avatar you're using has some familiarity for me.
the time elapsed equals more than six months and it seems i'm unable to move on.
it's possible he believes he'll be rejected. simply inquire. i'd do so.
you must contemplate that and it should provide assistance in determining whether or not he's trustorthy!
it is a picture in the shape of a heart with both of you in it from when you first dated.
he is my only source of income until i graduate from college.
i was with my ex boyfriend in the second grade and then in the fourth grade and then again in the eighth grade.
is it bad if i have not kissed the girl i have been with for eight months?
there are men that do not like the breast of a woman.
maybe she just wants to date other people?
we have seen each other every day for _num_ -_num_ years.
he arrived at his station, so he left the train.
the absolute worst thing would be her saying no. go for it and good luck!
i know exactly what i desire in a relationship.
i would flirt with him and send flowers and candy to yourself. then he would ask you out.
i also despise seeing my dad unhappy.
i know i snore sometimes, and i feel bad.
i need to know if i am in love.
if you love eachother, you can work out the fights.
you both do not want to call it quits.
that does not mean that big girls can not be cute.
he is, however, getting married this month.
those guys are jerks, and you don't want to associate with them.
please say you will go out with me.
you should get married only after you have been with a man for at least two years.
men have a peni and women have a clitoris.
separate the undesirable thing and move on.
it would be easier to do if i were upset, however.
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america.
you should becom acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
he knows that you like him, so just ask him on a date.
maybe we can go on a date and we will find love with eachother.
i am married now.
you need to date some new people.
as everyone has told you, do not get married too early.
i want to know if you have been to the doctor yet.
pay attention to what the other person says.
talk to your spouce about this.
you are young if you are interested in sixth graders.
what color would go well with a medium pink color?
ask them if they want to go someplace with you.
a trip to an amusement park including roller coasters or perhaps a theatrical museum.
or do you fellows prefer larger women?
the problem is that i care for him very much.
therefore i would say that they do succeed but not frequently. i hope this is helpful.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i accidentally did this in the past and my friend was angry that i deleted him.
i do not think i mind either way.
but that is her way. you could attempt it that way or you could remain watchful.
there are some that do, but you should be able to notice.
are you talking about your avatar?
i do not ever remember giving a woman a christmas gift, unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself, and not show off.
so, just take id daily and step-by-step. think of how he lost a good thing.
it is a shame that if only every man knew what women wanted, the world would be a much happier place.
give her compliments, honesty, and make it about her.
i believe that she will hurt him.
it only means that she is very interested in the man.
please do, but i believe that you would get slapped or kicked in the groin while you are in mid-reach.
she and i are only just now both divorced.
if the person wants to see your picture right away, it is about sex.
it is better than if you giver her a fake telephone number to call.
ask her to move to massachusetts.
if you feel this strongly about it, then maybe you should not get married.
based on the pictures i have seen, i would say maui or the bahamas.
the man i am attracted to is angry with me.
you are thirteen-years-old, so do not even worry about it.
that way you do not have to worry about calling him too much.
i am a man, and let me tell you, "we love to chase."
in advance, thank you for the pep.
we always seem to push away the ones that we love.
they think that they can control the lives of others when they cannot.
that is strange but perhaps. i do not know. i will speak to my friend later next to his locker.
i do not know. would you enjoy having an item inserted forcefully in your rectum?
if the man cares then he calls.
what gift can i give my future brother in law for his birthday?
he does not want to, either.
you can say it, but only if you mean it. also hold her hands, and look into her eyes.
some guys do; and some do not.
i would very much like to know so please assist me.
the timing simply was not right for it with the elderly man. you will see.
generally kind. and for my fifth, i will simply be disappointed if she is unintelligent.
it is one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe that you have to earn someone trust. i do not see how that is possible.
if that describes you, then you certainly need to stop. that is strange.
do not let her control you. she needs to learn to deal with it.
i have a yahoo e-mail address and that is sufficient for me.
do not concern yourself with it.
they never had a chance.
you know you were meant to be together if you can break wind in front of each other.
how old are they?
and any man who says he would is probably not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, there is no challenge.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you have some troubles ahead.
twenty to thirty-two is fine and she does not have to be younger than you.
maybe she does not love you but try using your brain and not your heart.
if you want your girlfriend forever, do not let her know that you want her forever.
tons of cheap ideas are out there, find what you like and work with it.
if you are worried about doing it, performance wise, do not do it.
find another woman and if it does not work out, move back.
most often (not every time) that will be boys around your age, give or take.
if you act like that all of the time, she may believe that you are desperate.
not every person here is in school.
tell him what you really desire, that is what i was told, but i never got to do it, speak up.
should i attempt the first interaction or should i wait for him to make his attempt first?
what a typical double-standard you have set up!
after a while, you do not even see the color.
i have not tried it yet, but i am still trying to wok up the nerve to.
asking her that question should not bother her, if you two are in a serious relationship.
ask her, "what is up with that?"
maybe ask if they would like to go on a date sometime soon.
look me up if you ever decide to visit florida.
those were great times.
she's concerned only about herself. no, that should not occur on a primary outing.
do you honestly want to spend your life with someone you argue with all the time?
if he comes to his senses, great. if not, then leave him.
you are too precious for those people.
attack him because he is interested in someone else?
it depends on the age, do they use cds or dvds?
you are twenty years old, you can start all over again.
i would like to visit the usa, what are things i will need?
if there is anyone who has any ideas, tips or just general information please email me.
you seem like a very lovely person, so do not let some of these women get you down.
if you go out and enjoy yourself, have fun and do not keep looking, a girlfriend will come along.
he is getting married, stop pursuing it.
is it similar to a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
if there is a short messaging system in your country, that you can get on your cell phone, then try finding a text-mate.
when she starts to close her eyes, lean in, and kiss her on her lips. then the rest is up to you.
please be honest with me, i can handle the truth.
most importantly, have fun and never get so comfortable that you know what is going to happen next.
doing that shows how much they care about you.
you should tell her that you miss and love her.
some ideas are to get coffee or lunch, sight-see, walk and talk, play in the park, visit a museum, or attend a movie matinee.
if what you want is a hooker, you can find one in any part of the world.
now we do all of these things together. i don't know what i should do.
because if it fails you will be in a lot of trouble.
also, for me at least, it has been the best thing.
if they actually apply, try using some of these.
the issue is that he did the worst thing that he could have done by cheating on me recently.
unless he is treating you badly, she should be happy that you are happy.
women like it when men are thoughtful.
he may call you back if you give him space.
tell him you are looking to keep it casual.
they will think you are leering if you look at them creepily.
i am not certain whether he loves you, but he definitely likes you.
if a man really respects you, then he will understand.
think about whether you can really afford it and, if you want to, then go forward.
because he is the type of superhero who most closely resembles an average guy.
in some cases the problems are worth it if the good outweighs the bad.
i do not think it is wise to date at work.
that is stupid because you need a theory class for that.
let it take course from there.
about what they think about gay marriage/relationships?
so of course i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
men will find you attractive regardless with this, generally.
however, i do not think that, by having intercourse with him, he will become unfaithful or leave you.
the safest rules of internet dating are: first, chat via e-mail and messenger; second, speak on the phone.
marriage is truly about trusting and communicating.
i had a similar problem as well.
it would depend on what you have kissed.
it would depend on whether you could trust him previosly.
you should make sure that getting your point across does not result in her hating you.
where have you been meeting this filipinos?
could you imagine if it was only considered love?
that way, you are not exactly telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
if he is, then go for it!
then, see if she is open for a dinner and a movie.
hello, i am sorry but i do not know and i wish the best of luck to the both of you!
however, i find him looking at me every now and then.
this is sin. we have started this.
entertainment includes eating meals, though not breakfast, if you understand me.
make a kind move. if there is no response, then you know what to do.
allow him to approach you. if you initiate anything, you will seem obsessed with him.
you people do not have the right to get married.
my tragic love story was that i loved him very much and he loved me as well.
you seem desperate and you will never find someone by acting desperate.
however, he insists that we are only friends.
looks do not really matter unless you are attempting to prove something.
i know once you have had sex with him, he is not longer a good friend.
the fact that a guy is so self-centered is a huge turn-off for me.
do not rush it. feel all of your emotions come alive.
its a two way street until you get them, then you will know which one.
so you have one baby out of wedlock?
i know i'm overly picky about people, how can i stop?
it hurts, a lot, maybe some girls might say that's it.
i'm going to jump that boy, is that the right choice?
it was a good idea.
it is not a turn off if she drinks too much.
some women will send men tiny messages without saying anything clearly.
i would prefer it if they left me alone.
you can ask her to go do something she is interested in, or see a movie that she would like.
you are a man, though i use the term lightly.
it is unfortunate that it is not automatic as with msn and aol.
that is how they will react to it. it is a bad situation for you and him.
return to that person immediately, before it becomes too late for you.
i also want to cause that person to stop smiling.
and, ask if he desires to dance with you.
then, she might state, "that looks ugly. i think blue looks better."
implore him to go visit a doctor.
i never accompnaied him a second time.
first of all, why did you break up?
why wait? go forth and execute it.
as long as he does not mind, who else's opinion matters?
i believe i am quite enraptured with him.
i never desired to have intercourse again.
the most important thing is to not attempt revenge on the one who wronged you.
if you must ask other people, then i do not believe you are ready.
i am a woman and i say those things.
a large area for savings is flowers.
time will tell. allow six months to pass and see what happens.
either that or you are the only one who will have sex with him.
from your list, i would choose spiderman.
i was cheated on for three of the years i was in a relationship.
all seniors think freshman girls are loose. it is sad, but true.
if he says, "yes," then you can tell him.
impress her with love and affection.
if you have experienced it, what was it like?
celebrate valentine's day with indulgence, give each other gifts, and have a good time.
any women standing beside unattractive men will appear attractive.
when i moved into the home, my neighbor asked me on a date.
you should approach him because he is obviously timid.
merely on a harsher scale as time passes.
be genuine. ask after their life and you may receive a response.
there have been many time you loved this guy but are not sure he feels the same way.
if you want a gift for your husband, i would suggest sports things or vehicle tools.
i like it, but i ran away.
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer.
what size breats do most men like?
many twenty-two-year-old women are in relationships with twenty-seven-year-old men, so the twenty-two-year-old men feel insecure and search for younger women.
without lust as in you only go on dates, correct?
they probably know, because you cannot hide that very well, but you should tell your parents.
i will declare you the princess of planet kripton.
my previous girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her and she remained with him.
my friend has a boyfriend who she speaks to online and on the telephone.
do you enjoy fake nails or manicured nails?
speak with her, girls desire to hear the truth, good luck.
we can rough house and be the best of friends.
stay faithful to your husband, after all, he is the one that you said i do to...
do not listen to these fools with all of there poppycock.
yes, i am a man, so i do not really have to pay.
remember: not bird has ever flown on a single wing!
just let her know how you feel.
it depends, if you honestly love him, you will likely think you will want to elongate it.
if you and the other person is married, run from the situation.
no, men do not, but younger boys, do.
help me win the debate with her.
my girlfriend is a bit crazy, but i love her, anyway.
it is simple enough. do the same as anyone else and play with it.
my friend, allow him to leave. if he is intended to be with you then he will return to you.
as you might expect, after three days of that my back was injured.
you need to stay alive, and get your life back.
do guys know what they want in a relationship?
you can ask him to lunch or a movie.
girls to not guys who are self absorbed.
do you like either one?
i continually chose jerks, when i was looking for a partner.
so no, i feel it is a choice, and one does what feels comfortable to them.
some do and some do not have it in them.
do whatever makes you happy!
for some reason, i cannot.
therefore, there is no alternative to the proper labeling of "love."
due to...as you're aware...attempt to look for your beloved...however, use caution!
avoid requesting a performance of any given portion; cast her in the spotlight role.
young females are basically struck by a person's ability to demonstrate a bit of concern, truth and respectfulness to them.
inform the miscreant of his require to vacate.
they think it is the right way.
i wish you luck.
you need to figure yourself out if you want to stay married to him.
i dislike him for that reason.
men like this become violent to their wifes if they do not obey them.
first, i have four children and being a homemaker is more work than my job.
i have not because i prefer men who look normal.
it appears that he likes you, and should should show him how you feel.
people today seem to be so open and fast-moving with most people
i sometimes reveal details about my problems too early in a relationship, and perhaps i told that man too much.
the right date can save money on many things.
if you truly love your man and want the relationship to work, then you must tell your ex to respect that.
that only makes her easier to potentially sleep with.
do not think you should try it!
simple. honesty and love, try to be true with them.
i was hoping for at least a _num_, but realistically i think it is going to be more like _num_-_num_
cuddling up with a large woman is one the best feelings i know of.
women expect men to act that way, so why should they grow up?
there area couple of ways. one of those would be to get him inebriated.
the problem is whether you are going to ask her out while at work or not.
remain with thirteen and fourteen year old men, they are easier to control. good luck.
you should never allow a man to mistreat you.
by the way, i am not the kind of woman who enjoys a romantic dinner at home.
when i divorced him, i swore i would never again get married.
phrases to initiate a romance are tawdry. be genuine and compliment her often. women like that.
you will be fine. enjoy yourself.
not always. men occasionally shave them. it depends on the woman.
i love him but i think i am ready to move on and meet new guys.
so wait for another four years.
i hope to see some of it soon.
i do not intend to be mean.
and you should wait a while before having children.
i would like to have some fun with you. that is why i answered this dimwitted question.
attempt to contact their question and answer team. they will assist you with the process. enjoy your day!
because women do not yield frequently.
if he insists then it indicates sex is his only goal.
option b: appearance certainly matters. anyone who claims otherwise is most likely being dishonest.
making love is similar to living in a fantasy.
they said something they do not mean.
try to make it yourself when possible.
there is always something else.
she is not into you anymore.
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that number of men.
on average, i would say that _num_ in the beginning, and approximately, _num_ once you get to know the person.
play sports with you male friends.
she will tell you if it is not good.
i did not mean, "do you think that women are seductive and beautiful?"
how do i get him to stop nagging me and leave me alone?
an intimate toy, so that you can both enjoy it.
in my opinion, men without hair look like little boys, and it is not seductive at all.
i agree that should just osculate him, he will respond one way or another.
a good way to try is to imagine yourself without him or her.
in america, it's not as important.
if it was previously to you, then he hadn't commited adultery.
multiple times i have passed on a great opportunity by concerning myself about someone else.
caucasian women are appropriating all the men!
your self image is as well very important.
have you ever had a pap smear?
how old are you?
i believe they both like me.
well, the first thing sounds as if you guys are already married.
yes, jaime is going to ask rubi to go on a date. but, it is not your business.
that is a sign. things like that can make it obvious.
you should take the time to get know both of them equally without going on dates with them.
i would love to hear your logical opinion on this, thank you.
if you like the man, then go for it.
having fun with guy friends is okay.
therefore it is natural for that man.
women accept a lot and sometimes they feel as though they do it for no reason.
no, because i am not yet married.
tell me your opinion. thank you.
if you are homosexual, then act like it.
good luck and hang in there.
i like older women so i think it is wrong that they cannot go out with her.
i am just curious about what everyone thinks.
i met my last boyfriend driving around a roundabout in another car.
because, if you do, you will lose your friend over a man.
it was truly a casual aside when i said it; i did not think he would remember.
are you a young woman from a rural environment or from an urban environment?
spend all day together and, to top it off, touch his feet.
i am quite bored with being single and observing while other women have all the fun.
all women are curious about sex, even with other women.
i'm unaware what you stated, because i was too lethargic to read your typing.
i dislike it myself. i adore the straight items.
i am "doc izzy" and i love and adore larger women.
there are not any words that will make things any better.
you need to do it before it is too late.
well, to be honest, you will learn but you need to actually do it.
navy pier or one of the museums are great places, and there are a lot of great restaurants in hotels.
that is a cliche (not the farm girl type, i should mention) also, i believe i am sexually appealing in a manner suiting myself.
he will most certainly refrain from rejecting your request.
well, i'm hoping you'll review this information very thoroughly.
a large number of males appreciate heavyset women; they are primarily african american.
should she express any interest, she'll phone at a future time.
no, you will not since you're cognizant of his inclination to be unfaithful.
inquire of yourself regarding the topic at hand, if you comprehend my intention.
i've discovered if i employ a concerted effort, i'm able to visualize a reality that i'm aware is not typically present.
let us purchase coffee and converse and proceed from that point!
simply proceed in your existence and locate an alternative person!
if you email me, i will give you my honest opinion.
we have been dating off and on since last year.
i care about you, and i can not stop thinking about you.
it is worth the wait when you are ready.
if you so not know, ask someone who has the answer.
hide your fears and tell him.
that is a risk that you are going to have to take.
if you are interested in being attracted to unsavory people, by all means, drink.
it is only for looking at it.
after a long time it passes and i still love him.
it is your own life as you said.
even now in divorce i am stuck with it.
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend does not mean he is.
sure, let me know more about you.
when one minute you want to throttle the other person and the next you want to have sex.
the women that are pretty, or a great personality.
people whose parents take good care of them may become lazy adults.
i do not know what she wants.
it is complicated. try to tell the story again and make it simple?
show her some of your talents.
can you imagine starting a family with him?
if you're not confident enough to ask, someone else may ask instead.
this is why i am single.
if you love him, then you would let him go.
if she does not want to be in a relationship with you, then be her best friend.
if he says he is not, then believe him.
let us get it out of an unanswered state.
i worked there for awhile and met a man who i love.
i've been with my husband for _num_ years, we got married in december of _num_
focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
you will see that no matter how hurt you are it's still the simplest reason why you smile.
wow, i didn't think pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop right away because i'm ready to relieve myself.
by all means, do not utter those words prematurely.
we don't know if she is sincere.
i don't want a man who does that.
then you make an easy decision.
i have sent sexual message to many girls.
he played a good game of basketball.
talk to your best friend and make sure they are ok with it.
is this a trick question?
is there anything i can do about it?
people choose to be husbands and wives for reasons.
if he does not then there are too many other options to tolerate that.
or is it merely that you would like to say that?
if you are not happy, fix it or get out.
not all men, but some do.
i agree with udaman, good luck.
it sounds like you enjoy selling yourself too much.
your girlfriend will think you are a jerk.
sometimes, but you have to observe the one you call your boyfriend.
replaying everything you ever did to me?
do not simply sit around and wait for the phone to ring.
i dated a man last year, and he got violent.
leave it alone. i do not care what she says, she is in enough pain.
how would anyone know if in fact they knew nothing about you?
find the one who loves you also.
it does not hurt to be flirtatious.
we were meeting up.
it is a turn off if you use pick up lines.
i do not have to ask anyone to the dance because i am a guy.
are there more guys then you think that love bigger girls?
a girl is ungrateful is she whines that flowers do not last.
you have found your true love and you need to be with them.
you need to really be her friend.
how do i get my partner to show me he loves me.
you need to stop talking to him and thinking about him.
they never met, but she says they are in love.
do not do this over the phone, email, etc.
i am not against homosexuals, they are the best friends i have.
i met a woman, and i want to know how to decipher if she likes me, or not.
death is similar to a box full of candy corn.
simply attempt to make the best of what is to occur.
either you progress with your life, or you attempt to coerce it to work with this person.
she is the love of my life, and i cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
women use their brains.
i still love my ex; and, i am mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
only time will tell, as such, spend time with friends and have fun.
i try to avoid chat rooms unless i need a good laugh.
i do not think i should have done that.
i do not know where to start.
because he cheated, i can either stay or leave my husband.
tell her to only call you regarding important measures.
that's all i have to say about the matter.
you should not be asking this question.
i was also thinking about going with lime green.
i am referring to both of you together.
i have a female friend that i am close with.
they want to be something they are not?
if you can, imagine yourself in bed with him at night!
they enjoy the challenge. that is what i love about it.
depends on the woman. black hair amplifies pale skin on a woman.
i should try this when i am dating in the future.
don't listen to what everyone else is saying.
i really like this man, but i can't tell if it is just a crush or if i truly love him.
i think that the bomb will be much easier.
it isn't always so easy, but there have been some great years.
do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer.
you inform her as to why you favor her.
is homosexual, or is it simply curiosity?
no, not if you must ask.
the list could go on forever.
but he might enjoy the waiting, dreaming, and teasing.
do not eat where you defecate.
of course if you want to chat, email me at fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com
when he teases you about trivial things.
if you think he feels the same way about you, then why not?
well, in my experience, one of them usually ends up cheating on the other.
often, they are worse than men!
i have heard of friends getting married just six months after meeting someone.
i do not know what you mean.
if you want children, then be a homemaker.
what is the worst that could happen?
a woman that is intelligent is a turn-on.
his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and how active they are plays major factors in attraction.
sure and will you pay mine also?
all i can say is, "i have long black hair and i am proud."
i was not going to let her come in first.
chances are, if you appreciate her as your friend, then you will probably admire her as more than that.
when you are with her, just be yourself.
guys seem to think they are special, and good enough for certain girls.
you need to find someone you like ask ask them to be your valentine.
you can post more questioins on yahoo! answers.
if a boy picks on you, why would you like him?
i like the movie brokeback mountain. it might be a guy, but you will be happy.
size, shape, and overall looks should not matter at all!
sexual intercourse is not the only thing important in life!
you are probably just too good for him, anyway.
are you or are you not attracted to him?
why do you not simply inquire if you may kiss her?
who is able to determine if rural women feel more sexually attractive?
i am not aware of your age, which would be helpful.
simply consider what you enjoy and reciprocate in kind, similar to a tongue massage.
here is my answer: choice a. most men certainly do not prefer women that are extremely thin.
cut your cousin and ex out of your life.
do they mock you when you are with him?
it is possible to give pleasure rather than receive it.
i keep thinking about sex with her.
are they a brunette or not?
is she trying to use you?
you can be big, but bad in bed.
you need to get rid of the ex boyfriend if you are dating the guy you love.
it hurt very badly and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, and playing with each others sexual organs before sex is important.
when he does, explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and that you want him back.
my boyfriend loves me to death and does not want to give me up.
why bother if you are already doing it?
we participated in coitus on the hood of my car in the light rain.
i think you're probably very nice, and she probably loves you a lot.
you're looking too hard, or maybe in the wrong places. sign up for something like yahoo personals.
only if you want to do it.
if she doesn't have a reason, then maybe she isn't your friend.
you have to figure out what is comfortable for you and your partner.
you are definitely not a promiscuous woman, do not worry.
girls do not think it is cool. they think it is men who smoke are deplorable because they are killing themselves.
so do you like asian food?
they did not mean to get them pregnant, they just cannot keep it in there pants because they are degenerates.
i like real women, i do not like faux looking prudish drama queens.
take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up.
that is too many, and indeed selfish. you are just desperate, keep on trying, okay?
it is similar to eating chocolate and then complain you look fat.
do you know that he loves you?
my wife forgives me for many things.
first you order one online and then the stork delivers one to you.
i would estimate approximately three or four.
imagine that i am that boy and be my girlfriend.
give them a chance to know the real you.
yes it is unusual but it is nothing bad.
i still love him and i do not know what to do.
do not stay with him only because of the baby.
be sure to never ignore her, listen to her, and do not change the subject.
it is good luck if you believe it is.
it in a mans ego.
it sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
good luck, but remember to do your homework.
don't go to the place, it seems suspicious.
just ask a woman walking by, they are everywhere in thailand.
this woman doesn't want a man who deceives her.
i want to be content.
you are so full of it. shame on you for teasing all of these desperate, lonely, and sad men!
in addition, men sometimes think that they do not need you that badly until you are gone.
good luck is all i can say!
hopefully, you married your husband because you love him.
i love to use poems to express my feelings to women. has anyone written a poem for a special someone?
why would you want to commit yourself to just one man?
that is, if you both agreed on doing this.
it is similar to saying, "what can stop me after i have already done it?"
he just has to start over and try to earn your trust again.
i met ______'s (insert name) father from his side of our family.
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us badly after we fall in love?
i am a person who wants to wait for sexual intercourse until i am totally in love with someone.
you should try being nice first. girls do not like being ignored.
keeping secrets only hurts those you love.
some women like big, hairy guys. some guys like heavy women. some girls like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
curves, especially if they have a large chest and art soft. you cannot beat a soft woman.
never tell her she is fat!
you are a mother, act like one.
others like to believe due to the way society dictates it. i believe we should rebel against society and appreciate curvier women.
give them two months and they will get over you.
i don't know, but user daniel k, has never even read manga.
i think it could be nice, it is your father's blessing.
i like intelligent, but attractive women.
come to my town, and i'll be with you.
this generation is too stupid.
yes, it is time to cash in your chips.
they are always in the "in love" stage.
whenever i see a malaysia air advertisement on television, i get capricious.
the way he asked me out, was very ingratiating
first, try talking to her, then ask her to go out as friends, and see where it goes from there.
this is very hard because there are a lot of temptations out there.
do not become what you are not simply because she says to.
the two of you should talk privately. you have to clear each other's side of the story up, now.
well, the one i enjoyed goes like this.
do not try to have sex.
keep it calm and a little hard to get. i may help.
if your relationship survives, you should be ready.
i married my guy. do you know why?
you need to move on and find someone who does not hate you.
we can just assume so.
we like pretty, good smelling flowers
should i, or should i not? younger guy versus older woman.
alright, those other replies are simply arrogant. i am way more attractive!
lime green would be more appropriate for a summer wedding.
however, let them get married if they cannot control themselves.
my boyfriend snores and i have a horrible time sleeping.
you may not think so, but the answer is yes.
we have no room in our society for crazy monsters like this.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
i believe his answer is good enough for me.
no man gave give you everything you want.
if he does not act right, then leave him.
if you're attractive, why not?
many men are similar to that, searching for sex.
i mess up often. she never forgets.
await for him to ask you out. unless you're very desperate.
are you asking if i like you?
make sure that your decision is your own.
you can't fix the relationship with her parents, but you may be able to fix the relationship with her friends. why do you ask?
how inebriated is this woman going to get?
men love women with a positive self-image.
i am doing this just for the points.
if you two do not know anything about each other then you cannot connect.
if you do, then i would say that it was a real relationship and completely worth it. good luck.
however, if you are used to it and enjoy it somewhat, go along with it.
it is because it is buy one, take one.
last but not least, does he always happen to be staring?
it sounds as though it might be illegitimate, however i can confirm that women enjoy it.
you have only met the foolish ones who believe thin is better.
in my opinion, there is a large difference between "having intercourse" and "making love."
you simply must force yourself to leave.
in my situation, probably _num_
lean in and give me a soft kiss just on my forehead.
i cannot see my life without my husband.
i do think that it is much more attractive and smooth as silk.
flowers are really pleasurable, even is they do not last.
is sounds like he may be having too much excitement while you are away.
why don't you just leave the girl alone?
perhaps you should try dating girls if guys offend you.
i do not have a single girl friend.
just remember, go for guys that are themselves and only themselves!
they feel that they are better than women but they are wrong.
that does not meant that you should let them in.
it is always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends she can talk with on the telephone?
getting married and having a child can wait, but studies can not.
however, you will need to do this a few times.
most teen-aged boys prefer teen girls like enjoy fornication.
enjoy the friends that you have and do not look back.
what is your personal belief on this matter?
i do not know what i should do.
it is a bad habit.
you will not loose your charm by _num_
my best friend does not like my boyfriend and wants me to break up with him.
we like it when you relax.
i do not believe so. perhaps, they should try taking our last names.
you both should pick either his or yours, once you have children.
of course, he wants to go on.
so, i suppose i pick domestic goddess.
ask her out on a date after school.
life is too short. live life to the fullest, and have faith.
i am man. i feel so as well.
if you are attracted to him that much, call him.
start with a simple question and move on from there.
you should tell more people; my boy did.
all that my friends want to do is to kiss all the time.
as well as asking if you are a good kisser and actually kissing.
i am at your service anytime and we will not regret it.
you need to replace it. add it back in just as it was the first time.
you can share this with your mother or father.
and do not believe the "alcoholic only on the weekends" excuse that the previous man is attempting to use.
you have exposed yourself to rejection, unless you are fairly well acquainted with him.
i prefer a and b cups, personally.
become her friend first and then see where that leads.
do not even listen to what any person says, watch the way that they act.
do you feel that way?
however if a boy asks you, do not be afraid to tell him no.
obviously she does not want you if you are aware that she likes the other boy.
there are plenty of things that make a woman not like sex.
not all guys get apathetic and move on.
but there is no better person to marry someday than your best friend.
it depends on what you are looking for.
i did this with my current boyfriend.
however, it does not mean you cannot love another.
simply divorce him, since he has no honor and does not love you.
basically, men are only interested in romantic relationships for the physical aspects.
if nothing works, you should ask him for it again.
it is your personal life, remain with it. whether or not a man goes on a date with you should not determine how you behave.
you must search within your thoughts for this one.
if the man is worthy, then you will not need to.
i am confused. i hate for the woman to be like that. what should i do?
shop around for the party supplies.
he then asked me if i could come with you.
if you like her so much, then just go with your feelings.
i am only myself around men that i do not like, and you know how that ends.
i hope you find a gracious woman.
i have adored this one woman since i was in ninth grade.
to all my fellow women at cone, a big, "hi," and a hug.
there is a reason she likes him.
if going to the movies is special for you two, then do that.
it sounds like you are the alpha in the relationship.
have you told her it is irritating with her checking up on you everyday?
it is for the same reason that thin women prefer slender, toned men.
he gave me his cell phone and asked me to enter my number.
go to hawaii (i am laughing) or pay someone.
i do not understand why people consider that it is wrong.
keep searching for someone who believes in romance because she is out there.
if you plan on cheating on your wife, you are not an honorable man.
he already knows that you like him. has he said anything negative about it?
confront him and ask him, then you will know.
it is more of a trust issue, i would say.
never stop trying to impress her.
no, you are punished. no television for a month.
i think this is better than the one on top of me.
that did not bother me because we are just friends.
go to school. you can still come home, or call your family and friends.
wow. go with the one that picks on you, because nine times out of ten, he likes you.
i had always felt the same way, but my views changed when i met my true love!
take baths, and learn how to speak?
i am attracted to him, and he says things like, "if i were not dating, then i would go out with you."
just get rid of him and you will be better off.
the one time in your life to truly live out the fantasy of true love.
people asked me, "what is the hurry?"
has he just broke him up with a woman and left before?
needless to say, i am _num_ and am still in therapy for it.
for goodness sake, do not be a controlling person.
did you ever think of that question?
is it normal to still have feelings for him after six months?
you should look for a man who is attractive.
she is a very sweet girl, just the person you are looking for!
is there a reason that you are not with the baby's father?
no it is not cool, and you are simply destroying your health when girls hate it.
anything bigger than a handful is a waste, so probably a size c or d.
i think that they do.
stop trying to flaunt it in everyones face.
you should probably be looking when public place where you are the most comfortable.
a man asked me, "do you mind if we cuddle?"
ask about the score of the game.
some couples never get to that comfortable, laid-back stage.
i always say that you should do not do something if you are going to regret it later.
even the day after would be okay.
well, all you are missing is a million dollar smile.
i understand you fountian, the same thing happened to me.
although, i do not like women all too much.
be nice, make eye contact, and smile often. i hope this helps!
i would wonder why he shaved them, but in the end, they are his legs!
best of luck to you both.
this is just what i have heard many times.
i like only natural things. faux is not my first choice.
she needs to be ten years younger, who want a more mature woman?
ask your best friend, if it would be alright.
many people will tell you, "no!"
downtown houston just about any weekend, there are lots of clubs there.
who said women don't feel anything?
and don't start with her looks, mister!
if they have moved on, then you should also.
flirt with him and see how he responds.
i am waiting until marriage but wondering what constitutes going too far.
there is nothing wrong with her taking your telephone number.
you do not have to act overly happy or hyperactive.
i do not want to randomly approach someone and ask them to go out with me.
his attempts to make it up to you will be enjoyable.
you give at least five minutes of kissing, hugging, and cuddling.
i cannot help anymore unless i have more information.
because i say no avatars.
some women prefer gifts that will last.
he is probably wondering if you are interested in him at all, so flirt back.
i feel funny and happy.
if you are promiscuous then he is also, but i personally do not think you are.
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
i do not need a trophy girl; i want a companion.
as a guy, let me say this.
be confident and always believe in yourself. do not be arrogant, always make good eye contact, and listen to what she has to say.
then he asked, "do you want some of my chapstick?".
there is not a wrong or right way to kiss.
we love them. it is not until later when we think about it, and about what was done before.
i would not know, i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you did?
it is like breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem crazy because you have known each other for a long time.
for the first answer that girl answered for me.
what about blue and green?
a life of your own is a life that you would be missing out on
i think that you are right, it is confusing.
the thing is that you do not have to ask her out to go out with her.
maybe he is going to call you.
be polite when you tell her.
i lost my virginity at sixteen.
i think all men like big breasts.
be proud of yourself.
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
we do not know what you look like.
if you could have four qualities in your girlfriend, what would they be?
search the internet. you will find many things for the wedding, or in your local newspaper or news.
if she sits on your best friend's lap because she is drunk, then yes, it is unappealing.
view my boyfriend by going to my _num_
one day, you will find a man who truly deserves you.
you and the erotic perfume that you wear.
if he is not and you are still not ready then do not be concerned with his opinion.
why do they want it to be state sanctioned?
and she still allows me to play with my trucks and watch cartoons.
you can still love him, but you need to move on.
find out if he is willing to go out of his way for you.
if anyone knows, please let me know.
i was never aware that life could be so good!
then he said that he would call me back.
choose the one you like the best.
if you really love him, you will tell him.
who actually knows but i would absolutely love for that to be done to me.
what should i do to get noticed by her?
man, you have to just get the courage up and introduce yourself.
there are actually movies that i have not seen yet.
i believe it all depends on age and upbringing.
and that will be merely intercourse.
my boyfriend was my friend initially and it is very nice.
what does other people's opinions matter?
also, try receiving some blonde highlights.
i use art to vent a lot of my problems through. you have to find a way to just let it all out.
if she likes music, then you can make her a special compact disc or tape.
it could be, you just have to choose one and know why you chose that one.
do not worry what people will say.
i think a lot of woman like receiving flowers.
i can't explain, it has nothing to do with them looking young and vulnerable.
forget him, and date his brother instead.
yes, they are there, you just have to look.
you can purchase them at staples for _num_
your child will find it difficult enough growing up without a father.
my friends say that i am overly nice and i ought to tell them no.
my girlfriend will not tell me she loves me to my face.
the right relationship happened on its own.
you will look silly.
no, you shouldn't care. if you like him then stay with him.
i think you should be your true self, have self esteem and confidence.
anything that is not nailed down.
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad.
one of my best friends has a thing with my big sister a few months ago.
should i forget it and move on?
they are friends on the other hand, that is a different story.
yes, i think anyone does!
my cousin met with a strange pervert who, online, had said he was an attractive teenager.
no women i'm attracted to in my list, therefore i choose my neighbors spouse.
i have long black hair, i love it, as my husband does as well.
if you truly care for your family. everyone in your family will love you.
unseemly or pudgy, men take what women they can obtain.
it occurred mid river, while people were watching. it was hilarious!
it is all about eye contact.
it depends on the man. some men do not.
it allows us to believe that you may be a coward.
if you love him and he loves you, then he may want to disappoint his father.
yes, some men do it without considering the woman.
maybe she is not a difficult person because she is skinny.
it does sound a big girl-like.
if you want to enjoy it a bit, why not check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms, etc.
a few good women are left, you simply have to look in the right places.
it is like everyone has gotten separated, eventually.
you win some and lose some; just take it with a grain of salt and be more careful next time.
happy birthday to you.
i just need someone to help me figure this out.
choose the one who treats you better.
i like a sixth grade boy too.
i do not go out with friends because if it ends then he might not be your friend.
stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact.
do what is best for the two of you.
bad teeth, breath and body odor.
no one needs to know that information.
if i ask i will leave, stop the relationship, and move on with my life.
do not get the wrong impression about what i said.
i asked him if he still liked me. he said he does but does not act that way.
where am i going with this conversation?
keep finding her younger and younger men, as one ages, find a new one for her...
you know that is, if you did not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean that it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
it is a wrong decision that cannot be undone!
practice by unwrapping starbursts with your tongue and tieing cherry stems with youru tongue.
did you see her looking at you?
i know three men i can do that with.
either ask her out or express your feelings toward her.
if he is an "on and off" type of guy, leave him.
if they do not, then you will have to get on with your life.
i have never been.
in my opinion you should compliment her, ask her name, act normal, and act smooth.
she calls him often.
how should i approach her and not be just another guy trying to proposition her.
wait a little while and then date, and that way you will enjoy it more.
someone who never acts mean just because she thinks it is cool when it is not.
you do not have any decision on your mind.
why should i hide it?
some men just do not like to dance.
she really is not your friend because she will not stop bothering you.
i wish i had heeded my friends' warnings.
after all that time, can you finally see that she just is not really interested?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
that is a no-brainer. oh, and nice picture of george clooney on your profile! ha!
some women cannot seem to find men their own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that was not too big.
it sounds like that you are both comfortable with things the way that they are now.
it is so sexy that it looks very nice on almost any girl.
sometimes it is better to be very good friends first to make sure that you are happy around each other.
anyway, my question is: will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill's music. love ain't like that is a great example.
please do not ask that question if you do not want to become upset.
and the girlfriend should accept that, if she loves you.
i think it is attractive for a man to shave his legs.
i do not think it is the best thing for you all to still have contact with each other.
i like this boy name austin, and i've commissioned my friend claudia to see if he has any affection towards me.
you are suffocating your romance by asking such a ridiculous question, have you ever considered just enjoying each other's company instead?
he is going to manipulate you, trust me.
everyone is different in their preferences, but i don't believe anyone would like you.
that is incredible, maybe you can attempt a first move.
if he rejects you, he is not worth a relationship.
just approach her and start a conversation.
it is a good idea to always be honest. besides, not many men i know do not like being told that they are attractive.
men who are not as attractive and do not have as much money know that women will not chase after them.
just face him and ask if he wants to see a movie.
that is why they call it making love.
if you smile at him once in a while he will know.
most girls are polite enough to answer it.
i would do it because you sound like my best friend.
say, hi harold, when will we be going to dinner together?
i think most guys don't care, but it may depend on the guy.
it will work out if you want it to.
give it up, he doesn't want to dance.
i feel like the guy should be the one to make the first move.
without having a boyfriend that would be a bit promiscuous.
you should wait. accept my opinion as woman in the military and wait.
you never know, my friend. they never show affection except for when they want something.
i am _num_ years of age and in search of a beautiful woman with whom to spend my time and there is the potential for more as well.
do you mean seem more sexually attractive?
navigate to deleted items and it should be there.
this must be a red flag of how this boy is. i wonder!
perhaps because your name is freakgirl, but if you reveal your face perhaps not, no resentment.
that would be very painful you know, trust me, i have been there and have done that!
do you love her in depth?
have fun asking your cellmate that question in jail!
no, the only time you will see an emotional man is when he is with his lady love!
yes, i have done it. it was a lot of fun!
got to let the person you are with know what you want.
of course, it would be crazy if she phoned five times a day about the subject!
wait for the one that appreciates you.
my mother books them all of the time. her email is: pat@alanatvl.com
besides, do you not think that he has enough to worry about.?
i have been dating a younger man.
men play at love to get sex, while women play at sex to get love.
after a while it has to be played out.
everyone, even if they do not admit it, likes to be told they are sexy.
yes, but it depends on the guy.
perhaps you think they look sexy when they run out onto the field.
you are too young to already discuss kissing.
i will probably tell her soon because she is my best friend. though any help would be appreciated.
before anyone gets hurt, i agree with the other person.
i am ready to move on, but i am still in love with him.
go out and try everything you couldn't do when you were in a relationship.
obviously, men aren't better.
what will happen if you ask him to be casual lovers?
you could play a "truth or dare" game together.
he sounds like he is a very manipulative, unkind person.
slow down the pace and maybe try foreplay.
death is like a big black bag full of drugs.
where do you live; you can practice kissing me.
no, you will not, my friend. i was married to someone completely inconsiderate.
it seems that you truly love her. there is no need to forget her.
inform him that you simply want to be friends and that you are very disappointed that he would behave so poorly.
it always finds a way to become public. simply avoid it.
gross, what is with the hair on the chest?
as for now, i believe he is angry, hurt, upset and moved on.
give your brother some money and tell him to leave!
no offense, but it kind of sounds like a girl's name, not to be disrespectful.
be cool and ask her on a date.
after you take her out to get to know her; you can go in for the kill and ask her out.
people do not like to be played with.
practice unwrapping starburst wrappers with your tongue because the girls love it.
i do not know; i just want the points.
that is not true. most girls are just discreet.
are you attractive looking?
i told him that it was too late. normally i would not mind getting flowers on occasion.
that is a strange way to put it.
why is it hard for men to say the word love?
just enjoy the age that you are and do not worry about all of this.
even though, i am only _num_ years old, i like my partners to be any age up to _num_
i have a friend in a similar situation.
women are just as deviant, trust me.
you should not go out with a man because you feel the 'necessity' to.
dude, what you are saying is she doesn
does it usually take about a year for both people to feel comfortable and bored?
probably because i knew all my former girlfriends were not right until i met my wife.
i believe it is fine, so long as you do not base your relationship on intercourse.
but some men would do that. why?
if you are an average man, then breast size should not matter.
stray away from men who cannot admit that they are interested in you.
yes, ask for permission. watch how fast she becomes violent with you.
my husband is with me for me.
my mother also has cancer, this is too personal for me.
be the best version of yourself, and if he is impressed he will talk to you.
you don't want to be with anyone, but that person.
why don't you start seeing other people, and see how he reacts?
is it okay to kiss on the first date?
men have issues with secrets.
i had someone get rude with me, because i was still dating.
so, how do i simply kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister, and i want it to be perfect.
unless, it is with the wrong man.
